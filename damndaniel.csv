0,5/28/2017,Tim M.,birmingham-2,5,"This is Birmingham's version of Nashville's Las Paletas..... except these could be better than Las Paletas! And they are a great value!Steel City Pops is by far the best dessert joint that I will try this year. The popsicles are good size and basically fills your whole mouth and they are served firm enough that you can sit there, lick, and salivate for 10 solid minutes on a single popsicle.Flavors - this is where they take creativity to the next level: Avocado, Pineapple jalapeno, Pistachio, and the list goes on. In 1 day, I had the pineapple jalapeno, cookies & creme, strawberry lemonade and loved them all.If I went to Las Paletas in Nashville, I would probably pay 10% more to get 15-20% less product."
1,8/16/2017,Kayla S.,birmingham-2,5,"I LOVEEEEE Steel City Pops! It's like you're having a treat but not eating too horribly. The location on 280 and the one in Homewood are both very convenient for me with one being close to my work and the other close to home. I've had great experiences at the 280 location. Whoever's working is always super nice and quick! My favorite flavor is the Avocado and my least favorite is the Pineapple Jalapeno. I know you're thinking, ""Avocado?! Seriously???"", but you HAVE to give it a chance! It's a creamy, citrusy and sweet pop that is very satisfying. I didn't like the Pineapple Jalapeno because there was just wayyyy too much heat on the end but then again if you really like heat, then you'll love that!"
2,5/2/2016,Lisa H.,birmingham-2,5,"Where else in The Ham can you buy frozen confections out of a spaceship-like recreational vehicle? The fourth store that opened, the Highway 280 location is definitely the most unique Steel City Pops for sure. Beyond coolness. And there's even a drive-thru. Steel City Pops, please come to Atlanta; I'd pick you over King of Pops any day.I love how the SCP team is always coming up with new flavors. Personally, I think the more innovative ones are the winter flavors, but summer is always great too. I finally tried a cookie pop ($4.50) for the first time during this visit. It was a brownie frozen into a chocolate pop. So yummy and fudge-y, you won't even be able to tell that it's all gluten-free. The other folks in my party went fruity and got blackberry, blood orange, lavender lemonade (a new offering), lime, and raspberry lemonade ($3 each). No complains from anyone, just content slurping, even though I assured them they could swap flavors if they really despised their selections.Some drawbacks to this location is that there only appears to be one person working, and there is no indoor seating. There is a small discount if you buy four pops. Check the SCP website to get an idea of what flavors are available and for nutritional information. Don't forget to get your Frequent Buyer Card punched so you can earn a free pop!"
3,9/17/2016,Justin W.,birmingham-2,5,"100% worth it. I was a doubter the first time. Then I wised up and realized these popsicles are so delicious. I generally go with creamy, and often a cookie version because I like those types. Any fruit ones I have tried are also good. They put the legit fruits and foods in these; not some engineered flavors. It's goodness."
4,12/13/2016,April D.,birmingham-2,5,"Love Steel City...  I just stopped by last night & got a 4 pack.  My favorite flavors are Avocado Lime in the summer which is Key Lime Pie if you close your eyes... Peanut Butter, Coffee, Pumpkin Pie, Carrot Cake, Chocolate Mint, Pistachio...   Yum!!!  My wallet feels lighter after I pay ... they are not cheap, people!!!  But I do it.  They are so yummy."
5,9/28/2016,Jamie S.,birmingham-2,5,I love all of the pops and the staff is always friendly and ready to serve  with a smile I get bags of 4 such a sweet treat!!
6,7/29/2016,Tiffany W.,birmingham-2,5,"Drove by their Airstream trailer several times before stopping to check it out.  Glad I did - charming Popsicle stand with lots of classic and upscale flavors, and quality ingredients.  I thoroughly enjoyed my peach cream pop. Can't wait to try more of their flavors!"
7,9/20/2016,Brandy D.,birmingham-2,5,My office loves taking a mid-afternoon break and going to the 280 location near Greystone. Yum!
8,5/11/2016,Hailey S.,birmingham-2,5,Such a good Popsicles!!! All flavors are very authentic and true to their names! Highly recommended. The best are raspberry lemon and coconut
9,8/8/2015,William R.,birmingham-2,5,Calling these popsicles doesn't do them justice. These are so good and we love the the variety of gourmet flavors! The buttermilk flavor is so good out of the creamy flavors along with strawberry lemonade out of the fruit ones. The chocolate chip vanilla cookie pop is by far the best in our opinion. It was like cookie dough wrapped in creamy vanilla flavor. We were familiar with steel city pops from living in Fort Worth so it was nice to discover them on a road trip through Alabama.
10,6/22/2016,Wes H.,birmingham-2,5,"Absolutely one of our favorite places to get a treat. They use the highest quality ingredients, and the staff is always friendly and helpful. I love how they change flavors according to what's in season, besides their staple flavors which they have year-round. Best popsicles I've ever had!"
11,3/31/2015,Casey W.,birmingham-2,5,"This place is so cute! I took my sister here yesterday to grab a Popsicle and we both kept talking about what a good idea it was, especially for the coming summer. I had passion fruit and she had strawberry lemon. Both were listed as under 100 calories and were very tasty. Very neat place."
12,3/15/2015,Tiffany G.,birmingham-2,5,Drive thru Popsicles... What more can you ask for?  I love this place!  The Pineapple Jalapeño and Cucumber Lime flavors taste like Heaven.  Yummers!!!
13,7/18/2014,Shelby R.,birmingham-2,5,"I was told by a friend that I had to stop here, and I am sooo glad I did! Who would have thought a Popsicle business could be so popular. It was so hard to decide what  flavor I wanted. Do I want pineapple or chocolate? Avocado or orange? Buttermilk or coconut? Blueberry basil or peanut butter? Peanut Butter! And I was soo glad I did! It was the best Popsicle I have ever had and you can quickly tell that it is made with fresh ingredients. They have fruity flavors like Blood Orange, Pineapple, Strawberry Sour Cream, and Blue Berry Basil. They also have creamy flavors like Avacado, Peanut Butter, Caramel, and Coconut. They regularly have new flavors. I can not wait to go back and try some more! This is a must stop place, and they have a drive thru!"
14,4/18/2015,Michael C.,birmingham-2,5,"Good ice pops with a drive through , what else could I rate it. Glad to have it here in the summer time"
15,6/2/2015,Mary J.,birmingham-2,5,What a fun place! An Airstream trailer outfitted as a popcicle shop. Flavors are numerous and interesting. I had a Maypaw pop--whatever that is. And is was scrumptious. A little sweet and a little tart and very refreshing. Husband had a blackberry pop and it tasted like berries just pick off the vine. Conveniently located. Easy to get to. and very friendly staff.
16,6/24/2017,Kat C.,birmingham,5,"What a great find! This place was awesome. Locally made.  Friendly staff. Unique flavors and traditional flavors as well. I had avocado and it was amazing! My sons had Watermelon and another had Chocolate. They were also great - I snuck a bite ;-). At $3 a pop, it isn't cheap, but the flavor and all natural ingredients are worth the price."
17,7/31/2017,Jeremy B.,birmingham,4,This tasty  popsicle shop is located in the Summit outlet mall off of HWY 280. There's multiple locations throughout the metro area. It's a great spot to chill on hot southern summer day. There's a variety of creamy & fruity popsicle flavors to select from. I prefer the creamy popsicles since I'm a big lover of ice cream. My go to is the chocolate popsicle that has a brownie in the middle. It's amazing  & I know you'll love it! Now I discovered there's locations popping up in Hotlanta!
18,8/17/2017,Julie S.,birmingham,4,"If you're in the area looking for a cold treat, this is definitely a good stop.  Enjoyed our popsicles!  On the pricey side, as our total came to around $19 for the four of us."
19,3/25/2017,Shaquita Y.,birmingham,5,"Chocolate (creamy) is never a let down. Tastes like your favorite soft serve ice cream in popsicle form.Out of all the available flavors I've only tried chocolate and strawberry lemonade because I can't seem to try anything else because these are the best tasting things ever.  In a liquid form, I'm sure the strawberry lemonade would be the best lemonade in a cup."
20,1/5/2017,Benjamin Y.,birmingham,5,"It's about to snow but I drove to steel city pops to get some ice cream anyway. My fiancee and I were glad to see the open sign. Surprisingly, there were several people in/out of Steel City Pops. I guess I wasn't the only one. On this visit, we picked coffee and black sesame seed. They instantly became my favorite flavors. They were gone before you know it. I like Steel City Pops because they don't put any unhealthy ingredients and you can taste the goodness in every bite. Great for everyone - both kids and adults."
21,3/25/2017,Amanda B.,birmingham,4,"Always super friendly and of course great popsicles!!! Only downside, which I know some people like is the creamy popsicles like chocolate leave a film in your mouth. But easy too look past for me because the flavor is so good. Their fruit varieties don't seem to have this same effect.  Love the little bags they give when you buy several to go we have never had a problem with them starting to melt before we get them home and  in the freezer."
22,9/5/2016,Maggie K.,birmingham,4,"This place is located inside a plaza. Tried this place with couple of friends while in Birmingham...I dint know pops could be so flavorful with wired combinations. Some are fruity while others are creamy.I tried the buttermilk after I stood blank for almost five minutes, to choose one pop. Trust me the buttermilk one was so so good than the others. So creamy and dint taste like buttermilk, it was more of eating a frozen cheesecake. My friend got a mango, it was good too. Much on the fruity flavor side. My hubby got a guava, I dint like it much but was just okay after tasting buttermilk n mango.The store is a little cozy with a little outdoor space."
23,8/25/2016,Debbie C.,birmingham,4,"I didn't realize there was one at the Summit! Much easier to park, haha. It's larger than the one by Little Donkey and (I think...) this location has more seating. :) My family always requests for Pops when they visit from Miami.Keep up the great work!!"
24,6/20/2016,Paisley B.,birmingham,5,"Straight up gooood! On a hot summer day of course I had to get a Chocolate steel city pop. I don't know what I was expecting, but it didn't taste anything like it. Instead it was flat out luscious! What a neat texture. I mean, I am truly fascinated with this pop. It's not quite ice cream and not quite a popsicle...I guess that's why they call it a creamy pop. Cuz they have some 'chew' to them like a creamy, fudgy, frozen custard bar on a stick. Look. I'm just saying it was good! Chocolatey. Chewy. And good. Service is good too. The place is simple. Easy to walk in and out. So you can march on enjoying your treat like a bosslady. At $3 a pop go and get yourself one."
25,4/9/2017,Victoria T.,birmingham,5,"I can't rate anything less than 5 stars for this place. Not only are the popsicles made fresh, but the menu changes daily. You can literally never run out of flavors to try. The service is always super quick and friendly. I always ask a billion questions about the flavor choices and the staff is always very patient. I ended up ordering the blueberries and cream. It was yum! Pieces of blueberry in the pop so if your weird about textures you might want to get something a bit more creamy. Beware, the prices for a Popsicle are a bit steep, $3.50 to $4.50 depending on what you get. A bonus, they give you a freezer bag if you are getting a few to go, which is awesome."
26,6/26/2016,Cynthia L.,birmingham,5,"Delicious! We tried avocado, mind blowing, blood orange, super refreshing, strawberry lemonade, on point, & lavender lemonade, whata combo.You really can't go wrong here perfection on a stick."
27,3/14/2017,Sadia D.,birmingham,5,This place is a true gem! I have never been able to find good popsicles in Birmingham before but these really do the trick. My favorite is coconut but the guava is my go to when I'm calorie counting. They have so many great flavors that are always changing and are quite affordable at $3 each. It is nestled near the Carmike theater which makes it a great post movie snack.
28,8/9/2015,Gregory S.,birmingham,5,"Delicious popsicles at fair prices! Unique flavors that are fresh and natural. I like how some flavors have a fruity tang while others are more smooth and creamy. Either way, they hold up against the heat in that you won't get melted juices all over your hand...nice! A must visit."
29,5/8/2017,H K.,birmingham,5,"I love these popsicles! I haven't had a flavor that I didn't like. Buttercream, strawberry lemonade, and peanut butter are my favorites."
30,5/5/2015,Raj D.,birmingham,5,"This place is absolutely amazing. I tend to travel often to Birmingham and this is my first stop after landing. The store itself is rather small but there are some chairs and tables located outside. This place makes home-made organic popsicles that you can die for. They recently began making ""cookie"" pops made of icecream and either a brownie/cookie in the middle. You can get a cool freezer bag if you chose to take them home with you. Try the: mango habanero, avacado, cookie, papaya, pineapple habanero, COCONUT (my personal favorite), and the habiscus. Honestly, you cannot go wrong. The price is a bit high for a popsicle but this is far from your ordinary popsicle and absolutely worth the price. I WILL ABSOLUTELY BE BACK!!!"
31,7/23/2015,Katy P.,birmingham,4,"It's a store that specializes in Popsicles. POPSICLES! There are enough options to please everyone, plus they have the calorie count with the item name. There's fruity, creamy, even cookie Popsicles. I had the blueberry basil Popsicle and it was delicious. My only complaint is that it was full of blueberry skin chunks and I was chewing them constantly. The flip side of that is it means they use real, whole blueberries. I would rather have that than unnatural flavorings. I do wish they had seating inside since it feels like a million degrees outside and I was paranoid about my Popsicle melting! I definitely recommend this place if you are in the area! It won't disappoint."
32,3/3/2016,Pauline S.,birmingham,5,I would give this place 6 stars if I could! Think the best Popsicle you have ever had and than turn it up to 10!The coconut dipped in chocolate or the blueberry  basil... If it's hot get the buttermilk... Place and service is great! Plus- can't think of a gift to give that family member who has everything... They have family gift cards!
33,4/10/2016,Avriel F.,birmingham,5,"This is my new favorite place ever! They have an awesome mix of comforting, familiar flavors and funky ""never would've thought of that"" flavors. The creamy pops are my favorite, with the coconut being my #1 go-to indulgence every Friday evening after work. Also, all of the flavors are natural (without added dyes or preservatives, I believe), so it's a relatively healthy option. The young, upbeat staff and the rustic-style atmosphere adds to the overall experience. The shop is pretty small and doesn't offer much seating, but it just encourages you to enjoy your treat outdoors when the weather is nice. The staff is also really considerate, offering ice packs with your pops if you've got a longer distance commute. Really, stop by this wonderful place while you're stuck in 280's gridlock 5 o'clock traffic. It'll remove your headache, and add some enjoyment to the rest of your ride home :)"
34,4/16/2017,El L.,birmingham,5,I found this place randomly and it changed my life. This is the absolute best place on earth and live too far to go regularly. If you are near this place you must go!
35,12/5/2015,Dominique V.,birmingham,4,"Good, rich, unique flavors! I enjoy their seasonal pops very much. This particular trip I had the cinnamon apple pop. I could have been eating an apple pie for all my taste buds knew! My only reason for dinging them a star is that they put shavings if the fruit's skin in their fruity pops sometimes. I know that's nit picky of me, but I'd personally rather have the meat instead of the skin in my fruity pops. It may not be the case with very fruity pop. The atmosphere is great. They don't have a very big place to sit and eat, so we typically grab pops and go walk. It's great stop after a movie, or after a day of shopping in the Summit."
36,5/14/2016,Nadine E.,birmingham,5,It's in a strip mall but what a great idea! Officially obsessed. The sundae bars are a LOT to handle. great place with fresh pops!
37,12/12/2015,Cat A.,birmingham,5,"I am a fan! Every season when the flavors change, I have to try all the new ones. If you try a flavor you don't like, they'll switch it out for one you do like. I've only had one pop I didn't like there, but when I went to try and purchase a new pop instead of finishing that one, they wouldn't let me pay and just gave me a different flavor.This is really a gem in Birmingham and a must try for anyone living or visiting the area. It's a great end to a date or a day out or just because."
38,9/6/2015,Jessica M.,birmingham,5,"If you haven't had a Popsicle from here yet your crazy. With multiple locations and boths at many events you can't miss them. They have sweet, savory, creamy, and sometimes a mixture of two. My first was a pineapple jalapeño, and I was hooked. The fruit ones are good but the creamy ones are my favorite. Plus they have Popsicles with gluten free brownies in them, Amazing! Coffee is what I get most. Then today I saw banana pudding and I melted. The kicker is that these little delights are made from natural and sometimes local ingredients. So I don't feel quiet to bad since this is more a healthy indulgence. Plus I can support local vendors at the same time. If I am ever eating at the summit I was save room for dessert, so I can go to steel city pops after."
39,2/22/2014,Heather B.,birmingham,5,"No doubt this is a popular spot, given there were only about 20 people outside the tiny storefront when I walked up. I really, REALLY wanted to try that Bacon bourbon molasses thing that has me intrigued, but alas, not on today's menu. I typically go for the fruity pops over the creamy ones, and I was gravitating towards the blood orange.... Until the pineapple  jalapeño spoke to my soul. The guy behind the counter jokefully asked me if I was sure that's what I wanted...I guess I must've ordered with authority. When I told him I was pretty sure, he offered to let me have a blood orange if I hated this one (hence five stars!). He didn't have to give me a free popsicle, I was beyond pleased with my choice! I'm sure I will come by here A LOT  this summer."
40,7/12/2015,Catesby D.,birmingham,4,Very good! I had the coffee and my brother had the chocolate. They were both very good. Had a variety of options and I appreciated that they had the calories listed for all of them.
41,8/24/2013,Ee Vonn Y.,birmingham,4,"$3 per popsicle but it's a novelty so what can you expect?I got the strawberry fig which had a sharp, distinct taste that I felt like I was almost eating soft frozen strawberries.It was that good. The service was prompt and quick. My person gave me good recommendations when I couldn't decide between pineapple jalapeno and strawberry fig. And I was glad I got what I picked. I wanted to share it with my friend but I didn't think she'd appreciate the drool."
42,10/16/2014,Brian H.,birmingham,5,"Sure, $3 a Popsicle is pricey, but where else are you going to find a Maple Bacon Bourbon Popsicle?I had never been here before, but had heard it was good.  Ended up getting 2 dozen pops, each a different flavor.  The service was great in helping us pick flavors, and they packed them in a foam cooler/box with some ice packs to make sure we got home without them melting.Overall, the quality of the pops is great.  Some flavors we didn't like as much (sweet potato pecan we felt had an undesirable ""frozen mashed potato"" texture), but we were big fans of ones like Cherry Sour Cream.It was a nice treat, and if we lived in the area, I'm sure we'd be in for a pop from time to time."
43,8/21/2016,Lisa F.,birmingham,5,Awesome Popsicle!  I had the buttermilk..........which takes just like cheesecake!  Yummy!
44,6/27/2016,W D.,birmingham,5,What a wonderful selection of unique flavor a! So far every one I've tried has been amazing! Most are gluten and allergen free!
45,8/4/2013,Lacy W.,birmingham,3,"I've been 3 times. There are pros and cons:PROS: Most of the flavors I've tried are good.          If you don't like a flavor, (I couldn't even eat the raspberry because there were so many seeds) they will GIVE you another flavor of your choice.          Plenty of flavors to choose from.CONS: Only three benches outside to sit And on weekends it's always crazy crowded.             The popsicle sticks are not long enough at all. Very hard to hold with only a little one inch piece of the stick at the bottom. Especially for kids. You either end up dropping it or making a big mess.             High prices for a popsicle. I know the ingredients used are good, expensive ones, but it's just more than I want to pay for a popsicle. You can make the same things at home for a lot less."
46,12/23/2015,Harry L.,birmingham,5,"A wonderful quick stop to get delicious pops to drench your thirst at any time, especially on weekends when visiting Birmingham. Don't forget a cooler to bring some extra home."
47,6/12/2014,Lily L.,birmingham,5,Holy bananas these are amazing! Today was our first stop in after being recommended by a local. It was love at first bite with the coconut and the vanilla bean. Both were equally creamy and delicious. The coconut has has toasted shreds towards the base of the Popsicle which gave it a little something extra. Next I'm trying the avocado sweetened slightly with sugar and lime. Please bring these to Arizona!!
48,6/17/2013,Caleigh R.,birmingham,4,"Had the chocolate pb tonight---very good, but melted very quickly.  My friend had raspberry lemon and we shared. Good combo to go back and forth with. I hope the do strawberry balsamic again soon!:)"
49,7/5/2013,Garrett I.,birmingham,2,"I have only been here once but so far, I dont know what the hype is.  It tasted like a to popsicle like the one I got out of an Eddy's box from the grocery store.  I listened to reviews and got the most popular one (strawberry balsamic).  I will give it another try to try to understand the hype.  Have I experienced a better popsicle store...no.  BUT, there are plenty of better places to drop $4 on a quick sweet treat."
50,2/14/2014,Lauren S.,birmingham,5,Best dessert place  in town. Great service. They catered my wedding an did a great job!
51,6/23/2013,Amber G.,birmingham,3,"Love the unique flavors!  The buttermilk is awesome, but my fave is the peanut butter.  I do prefer the Homewood location.  It's a bit crowded at this branch.  And do be very careful parking.  Parents are not always watching their children, and kids tend not to watch out for cars.  There are only benches to sit on along the walls, and you can bet that some mom with a couple unruly kids will be taking up the entire stretch of sitting."
52,6/29/2014,Amy J.,birmingham,3,The manager at the local Jim'N Nick's Bar-B-Que recommended Steel City Pops and we're glad she did. The popsicles were a bit pricey but delicious. I especially liked my Cherry Sour Cream popsicle and the place is clearly popular because it was very crowded!

Updated review",Darleen O.,birmingham,4,"This is a rewrite for the management team at Steel City Pops.  In this day and age when most businesses rely on social network feeds, its great to know that Steel City Pops cares enough about their product and brand to reach out.  Received a response from Andrea who was more than gracious with her response.  KUDOS to Andrea.  With that being said, I will take her suggestion and return on my own to perhaps try the buttermilk. I am more than willing to give this establishment another try as its refreshing to know Steel City Pops TRULY does care about their customer's experience."
54,6/15/2015,Andy M.,huntsville,4,"I thought my creamy Coconut popsicle was excellent.  However, my wife said she liked her Chocolate pop even better.  I'm actually inclined to give the whole place five stars, but that might set your expectations way too high, as the only menu items are gourmet frozen pops and bottled water.  I wonder what they do in cold weather.   Our frozen pops were an even $3 each, tax included.   Try this new place quickly, before all the kids find it.  I expect it will become very popular during hot summer afternoons and evenings."
55,4/8/2017,Kelly S.,huntsville,2,"I stopped by here in the evening on the fourth of April 2017 and the shop was empty with a single employee that was less than excited that I'd walked in. I'd seen photos online and was under the impression you could have the pops dipped in chocolate, etc. but I'd never been here and didn't know. I said, ""Hi. How does this work, with the flavors and coatings and such?""  She pointed to the menu and said, ""We have milk based and we have fruit based"".  Then she leaned in the counter and waited for me to speak. I picked a single flavor and I left. I did not get (or ask about) toppings or coatings because I assumed I'd confused what I'd seen online. She was less than welcoming so I had no desire to remain inside. After departing I realized I didn't confuse what you could get. Unfortunately, while the popsicle was really good, the service was lackadaisical and a real turnoff. If I'm in Huntsville I would try it again but employees need to exude a demeanor that doesn't say, ""Why are you here, you're nothing me."""
56,2/27/2017,Laura H.,huntsville,4,Wow! This place is fantastic! My friend brought me here when I came to visit! I love to eat ice cream year round.  And I can customize how and what I want on it! So I got the coffee with milk chocolate. Next time I will be adding some other stuff to it...Best idea since sliced bread. Seriously you have to check it out!
57,6/3/2017,Crystal H.,huntsville,3,Great pops but the two ladies behind the counter were eating and drinking and fixing their hair all while waiting on customers.
58,7/10/2016,Jennifer S.,huntsville,2,"The popsicles here are amazing, but the customer service I've received the three times I've been here have just been plain rude. I understand if someone's having a bad day and aren't the friendliest, but it's different story when you walk in and feel seemingly un-welcomed from the two girls who work the cash register. I usually never write reviews, this is actually my first time, but I just feel like I had to say something."
59,11/9/2015,Cheri W.,huntsville,5,"Oh my goodness.....we went to a lot of trouble to find them as our mapping software had them in an opposite area of the outdoor mall, but we are SOOOO glad we persevered in our quest for a gluten-free organic dessert.  They have fruity or creamy options and the staff recommended ""Buttermilk"" flavor.  I have died and gone to heaven.  He said that is by far their most popular flavor.  Described it as tasting like cheesecake- I disagree and say it tastes like heavenly buttermilk pie.   HEAVENLY I tell you.  We walked to our car and had to go back for more as our hotel has a refrigerator.   Gotta love that!.  Purchased a 4-pack and saved $1. To -go bag is lined with foil and has a freezer pack inside. Perfect. So don't hesitate getting more to go.  Buttermilk was 228 calories while I saw the most was 340 calories (Butter Pecan)I believe.  You won't be sorry- give it a try soon!!!"
60,6/24/2016,Zach S.,huntsville,5,"Very good pops! I went here today with two other people, and they were very pleased, too! It was a nice break from the hot, summer day! The chocolate pop was super creamy and great! I would recommend this place to anyone! Super cute interior...Very unique!"
61,10/16/2015,Ken D.,huntsville,1,"I received an unsolicited email after I made a purchase from them despite never providing my email address.  I can only assume my credit card information was somehow used to mine my personal information.It's a breech of privacy, and I would not recommend support of any business who utilizes these businesses practices."
62,7/9/2015,Sarah J.,huntsville,4,"So glad we have one of these in Huntsville! The best one I've had so far is the cantaloupe...truly delicious! I've had the coffee, too, which has coffee grounds in a thin layer on the top (don't expect something extremely sweet, though). Very good, pretty clean. Wish they had more of a selection though!"
63,8/10/2015,Britni C.,huntsville,5,strawberry & passionfruit are my fav! come while it is still hot outside! definitely a thirst quencher!
64,9/16/2015,S S.,huntsville,5,Best pops I've ever had! Definitely a must if you are at Bridge Street! If I could have these pops every single day I would. The coconut is amazing.
65,4/4/2015,Lisa H.,auburn,5,"Typed letters on a glowing screen cannot express how giddy I am over the new Steel City Pops location in Auburn. Huzzah! I've gone to the Homewood location a zillion times, just call me a SCP devotee. The Auburn outpost just opened yesterday, as it turns out.The mango pop has sort of been my white whale. I've tried to get it before on several occasions and have been thwarted every time. Always sold out. Today I finally got to try it, and it definitely lived up to my expectations. A taste of the tropics on the Plains.I love how there are several rotating fruity and creamy flavor options to choose from. Out of the current offerings, I highly recommend blackberry, mango, avocado, and buttermilk. Each pop costs three bucks.This location is pretty small with very limited seating, and I saw a lot of folks strolling around downtown, happily slurping on their frozen desserts. I actually ended up getting my pops to go, and the employees will put your pops into a special bag with an ice pack, perfect!I didn't get to ask, but it appears that the pops are imported from the Homewood location. I'm looking forward to trying the cookie pops in the future. Be sure to pick up a punch card; buy 10 pops and your 11th is free!"
66,9/2/2017,Robyn L.,auburn,2,"Atlanta pop-up cart, The Shops Buckhead Atlanta- very disappointed.  Last time I purchased a Strawberry Lemonade, which as very good by the way, they were $3.  Now, they are $3.75. Boo!Maybe my last Pop.."
67,7/28/2017,Sarah N.,auburn,4,"I love cold desserts in any shape or form so this place is really special to me. I like that they have more than just a typical vanilla, chocolate, or fudge popsicle. They truly have quite the array and the menu is constantly changing. They have the calories for each popsicle written down underneath which for someone who likes to watch what they're eating I really appreciate it. But don't want to deter you from one of their delicious cookie pops, the cookies and cream and brownie ones are amazing."
68,9/18/2016,William W.,auburn,4,"There are better popsicles in various spots throughout America, but when you're heading to an Auburn game and trying to beat the heat, these dynamic flavors hit the spot and tantalize the tongue.With bold combinations and clever ingredients, a menu covering all the standard flavors coexists with such daring ingredients as curry, basil, hibiscus and smoked fig, tastes you would have never imagined in a frozen treat.The lime and strawberry lemonade versions are my favorite so far, and I'm obsessed with anything root beer flavored but Steel City Pops hasn't perfectly mastered it (pretty good though). The peach cream wasn't amazing, but you practically can't go wrong here. Especially when the weather is hot!"
69,6/17/2016,Courtney B.,auburn,5,"I absolutely love that SCP has a brick and mortar location here! Every pop I've ever had been delicious, but my favorite will always been the blood orange."
70,3/5/2016,Brooke S.,auburn,5,It's all about the Buttermilk Popsicle.  It's the best.  They also just got an espresso machine and I really like their espresso.
71,4/16/2015,Will P.,auburn,4,"I tried the Chocolate and Brownie pop and it was badass, but for $4.5...honestly I can't imagine anyone justifying $4 for one of those. Not a price fan, but definitely am a pop fan."
72,8/8/2017,Beth E.,tuscaloosa,5,"Being a vegan in the south, I love when I have options. Steel City Pops makes many fruity selections for a vegan, but they also have a dairy free ""creamy"" option..avocado! It tastes almost like key lime pie. I am obsessed. Also, if you don't like your first choice of the pop you ordered, they are very accommodating about letting you choose another one."
73,5/2/2017,Rae K.,tuscaloosa,4,"It's in downtown Tuscaloosa it's a little out of my way to come visit. Though as they say, it's a treat. I absolutely love that Steel City Pops is a store dedicated to popsicles. Legit a store that gets that I don't want ice cream or yogurt. Especially moving from Hawaii and ""traveling"" cities away for the best shaved ice. I digress.I've been to the company two times. This specific establishment once. Had the honeydew popsicle... a 'meh' in my book. It was the actual fruit and sugar that had a battle for my tastebuds. I will visit again, so keep doing your thing."
74,9/12/2017,Grace T.,tuscaloosa,4,"I didn't expect to love this as much as I did. I had a chocolate one, and it was perfectly creamy and absolutely made my day! If you live in Tuscaloosa or are just visiting, don't miss this place."
75,3/27/2017,Elizabeth M.,tuscaloosa,5,"Great place to grab a cold treat! My favorite are the cookie pops with a bona fide cookie in the middle! Delicious! I have also had a Blueberry Basil which was not good and tasted like straight up grass but I blame myself. The menu is full of great options! We stopped here to grab a quick treat for the road, and it was so good we stopped on the way back as well! Very good!"
76,2/20/2017,Haven M.,tuscaloosa,5,I know that they are really good and bursting with fruit flavor. They pops are the best I ever had.
77,8/12/2016,Madison H.,tuscaloosa,5,"First of all this place is a hidden gem which I think most people know about. It was delicious and they had a flavor for people who don't like the fruit thing. The workers were extremely kind and knew exactly what they were taking about. Overall very refreshing on a hot Alabama day and a nice price to it cost about 11 dollars for 4 pops. We got the Pineapple, Strawberry Lemonade (overall favorite), Peach, and Coffee (which is coffee ice cream in pop form with caffeine)."
78,4/14/2016,Alex G.,tuscaloosa,5,Yum! Creative and delicious Popsicles . I like these better than any fro-yo or ice cream I've found in Tuscaloosa
79,6/9/2016,Mo F.,tuscaloosa,5,"Tuscaloosa is really lacking in the ice cream department, but SCP really hits that spot. There are lots of creative flavors to try, like lavender lemonade and jasmine green tea. Some classics you can't go wrong with--coconut, buttermilk, avocado, black cherry sour cream....They also have espresso drinks with Octane coffee."
80,6/18/2016,Vincent F.,tuscaloosa,4,Amazing. My brother and I were in town to take care of family business and on our last night we wanted to check out the college campus and stumbled into this gem. What a great idea! Homemade popsicles!! I got the Amaretto Cream and the Coffee. My brother got Cantaloupe and Strawberry Shortcake. We almost turned around once we finished all 4. We weren't that far away since we ate them so fast.
81,3/30/2016,Savannah B.,tuscaloosa,5,"This is a favorite summertime stop for my family.  As a former Midwesterner I consider March through October or so summer, so we make frequent stops here.  I haven't had a flavor I disliked.  Everything is delicious."
82,1/31/2015,Robin R.,tuscaloosa,5,"I have never had a pop here that I haven't enjoyed. I've tried coffee, strawberry balsamic, buttermilk, & avocado. They now offer any flavor dipped in chocolate. Love this place!"
83,10/23/2015,Jack K.,tuscaloosa,5,My first time there. I'm in town for work and a co worker saw it on a food search. We thought we would try it for dessert. It was AWESOME. We plan on going again tomorrow. It was that good. I just wish there was one by where I live.
84,12/18/2013,Megan O.,tuscaloosa,4,"Last time I came home for a visit, mom and I stopped by for a popsicle. I love popsicles but don't eat them too much.The shop is sleek, clean and located downtown just a few blocks down from Mellow Mushroom. They have several (it seemed like at least 30) flavors written on a huge chalkboard behind the register. Some are fruity and some are more creamy/savory. I chose the Orange Mint Tea and I think mom got Coffee. I liked my pop but thought the mint flavor could've been a little stronger. I also tried my mom's and it was especially yummy.I went to the location in Homewood later in the week and tried the Buttermilk flavor. I was really unsure of how it would taste but holy wow was it good. It sort of tasted like cake batter. I would definitely order that one again.I can see myself coming here on all my future trips home. If gourmet popsicles are a new food trend, I can get down with that."
85,12/17/2013,Jason B.,tuscaloosa,4,"Tried these for the first time last week. I had the wassail (it is close to Christmas) and MC had coconut dipped in chocolate.  Both were very good.  Friendly and helpful staff to boot.Admit it,  you are either saying, ""What the H is Wassail?!""  or you are singing ""Here we come a wassailing""  and cursing me for getting it stuck in your head.  -  I'm good like that."
86,10/14/2013,Kevin M.,tuscaloosa,4,"One of a kind Popsicle place folks.  Yeah, let me tell you that this kind of a treat doesn't offer itself to many people in smaller southern towns but Tuscaloosa has scored not only BIG in the annuals of SEC Football History, but now can boast it's very own custom made popsicle treat joint.  The only other places I've ever experience a fresh made fruit Popsicle is in foreign countries like Brazil or Guatemala.  From single flavors like the reliable strawberry and ever dreamy pineapple, to the eclectic sour apple, or the hot fudge and caramel Popsicle you're sure to have memorable visit that will have you dropping by any and every time that your in T-town.  My only complaint is that your not allowed to tip the counter people for the over the top patient and informative customer service they offer each patron."
87,12/25/2013,Julian C.,tuscaloosa,3,"Sometimes the selection of popcicles is a little ""meh"" so your experience may vary.  Pops that are out of season are on sale at a slight discount at least.  My favorite was the pinapple and peppers :( I know I'm gross but it was delicious."
88,3/15/2014,Sarah B.,tuscaloosa,5,"Love these pops!  Made of fresh, seasonal and natural ingredients, they are worth every penny.  I've had these pops at Pepper Place market in Birmingham and was ecstatic to see a location was opening up in T-Town.  My favorite flavors are cucumber lime and tamarind but every one I've tried has been amazing.  Skip the overdone froyo and try a pop instead!  You won't be disappointed."
89,8/12/2013,Kristal T.,tuscaloosa,5,"Steel City Pops is a great new addition to the Tuscaloosa downtown area. I was thrilled when I heard they were adding a new location here, as I am a previous resident of Birmingham and moved here for college! All of the flavors I've tried are delicious and I love their ""creamy"" or ""fruity"" selections. The peach and orange cream are my favorites! I work for a local hotel and will always recommend Steel City Pops to all of our visiting guests as a great place to cool off!!"
90,9/5/2013,Tm R.,tuscaloosa,4,Something different for your sweet tooth! Popscicles are $3. Lots of in season flavors made from fresh fruit a simple syrup and sugar. They have a large selection that changes often so you shouldn't get too addicted to any one flavor. Staff is really friendly but it can get a little too crowded inside. I recommend the maple bacon bourbon!
91,8/20/2013,Carole D.,tuscaloosa,4,All fresh ingredients.  Simple but delicious.  We tried the Latte pop.  It was very rich and creamy...almost a bit too rich.  Two of us decided to share it and we couldn't finish it.  But the flavor was excellent.    I will definitely try the fruity side of the menu next time.

Updated review",Devora H.,homewood,5,Is always a fun treat to stop in and see what's new at Steel City Pops!   Tonight tyke 2 flavors we got were coffee and Bananas. I'm a huge fan of coffee- nice coffee flavor with just enough sweet and cream :). The banana was really good- had a hint of cinnamon.   I think one of our all time favorites is fig and smoked (Gouda?) but only available around holidays I think.
93,7/23/2017,Michelle N.,homewood,4,"My boyfriend was in town visiting me and I wanted to show him all the local Birmingham sights so I took him to Steel City Pops! We stopped by on a late Friday afternoon to cool off with some popsicles. He tried the strawberry cream and I got the lavender lemonade pop. They're not kidding around with their flavors, I definitely tasted the lavender in my popsicle, it was pretty tasty. My boyfriend also enjoyed his popsicle. A small suggestion: I wish they'd have put the customize options on the larger menu so you see your options as you order, not on the side. Overall, a great place with delicious, flavorful popsicles!"
94,6/24/2017,John S.,homewood,4,"Had I not known it was here and intentionally stopped by, I would never have seen it. I almost missed it anyway. Parking even on a Tuesday evening was bad. Had to circle the lot before I lucked across someone leaving. Based on this experience, I might avoid it and other businesses on weekends.I had the special of the month Strawberry Milkshake (Strawberry Cream pop dipped in White Chocolate and drizzled with Milk Chocolate. Definitely recommended!My wife chose the Jalapeno Pineapple and liked it but despite being a big fan of jalapeno was not able to finish it due to ""heat"" factor. I think she wished she had gone with her second choice the Chocolate Chile in spite of the staff recommendation.I will probably return but parking could play a spoiler."
95,9/28/2017,Lucy T.,homewood,5,"Out-of-towner's have asked me what the one thing they need to do while they are in Birmingham is. Get Steel City Pops! I have never ever not loved a pop they have. Although both this location and the one at the Summit are rather small, this one can accommodate about five or six people to eat inside and about that many outside too. There's so many interesting flavors. My favorite fruity pop would be strawberry lemonade and creamy pop would be a toss up between coconut and vanilla bean. I'm really curious about the avocado one though, and the cookie pops seem quite intriguing too. I can't wait to be back! I don't care if it's 40 degrees out, I'm getting a pop! Very ""cool"" pops."
96,9/23/2017,Vu N.,homewood,4,"This location was my first time ever experiencing SCP and I've been an addict ever since. I first started off only ever getting their creamy pops, but I've evolved since. I only ever get the fruity pops now, and let me tell you, SCP knows how to make a fruity pop. I really appreciate that they list their calories and the nutritional values of all of their pops, this is really helpful for those who keeps track of their caloric intake. Parking here can be an annoyance, especially on weekend evenings, but sometimes, it's the location closes to you and you just need that SCP fix."
97,5/1/2017,Crystal Grace G.,homewood,4,"Coming to Birmingham there was a lot of hype over this place. Wasn't sure what it really was besides the fact that it was some sort of pops.Walked in and loved the aesthetic layout. If you know me or read my precious reviews I always love talking about the interior or design of the inside space. Customer service is awesome here, the staff is friendly and very helpful! If there isn't something you like you can switch it out for something else.So steel pops they are handmade popsicles of all different flavors and sorts. They range from fruity flavors, to classics, to interesting ones and they also have dairy free options! I got blueberry cream and was disappointed that it was more tart than a sweet cream flavor. Someone got a coconut with dark chocolate and it was AMAZING. I suggest sticking with the classic flavors more than trying something out of the box because it may not be as it seems. The avocado one seems really appealing but I was told it tasted more like lime than avocado. It's not really something I would go out of my way for but if you are in the area I would encourage you to try it out! It's not too expensive either."
98,6/17/2017,Denise D.,homewood,5,"So good. Would definitely come back. F O O DStrawberry Cream: its so good! It's a safe first time choice but definitely unique. It's light and sweet but creamy. Definitely a good choice for fruit lovers. Peanut Butter Pie: it's yummy! It has a peanut butter cookie inside while you chew on the popsicle. Great choice for peanut butter lovers.Vanilla Chocolate Chip: it was good but once we tasted the peanut butter one, we preferred the peanut butter. S E R V I C EThe girl at the front was so friendly. It made our first time a very pleasant experience. She was informative, introducing us to the food.A T M O S P H E R E / C L E A N L I N E S SBathroom floor is sticky and has flies. Super gross. But it was well ventilated. The restaurant and outside the restaurant has a very hipster, rustic vibe. It's clean and has AC on blast. It's so cool in here, which is great for dodging the summer heat."
99,6/23/2017,Samantha A.,homewood,5,"Popsicles are the new cupcake, and I couldn't be happier. This is the perfect spot to cool off and hang out with friends. I loved the many topping options and enticing flavors. I picked the peaches and cream popsicle. I'm usually a chocolate kind of person but this was the right pick. I could tell it was made from fresh tasty peaches! No fake syrup flavor or anything else. It's a small location, but there is some seating outside next to the bar. It has a cute photo booth area with different cutouts. How fun! If I lived in Birmingham, I would be here every weekend! Definitely a great summer spot to cool off."
100,6/25/2017,Reepa P.,homewood,5,Yum yum yum! Love this place. Peach cream is delicious! We got here right at 12 when they opened and there were people waiting outside already! Perfect little snack on these hot summer days.
101,10/14/2016,Honey H.,homewood,4,"Great flavor, but would be so much better with toppings! I was used to being able to have my popsicle dipped in chocolate then toppings added right after, so this place was a bit off for me. You basically come and get an already made popsicle in their freezers. There are a lot of different flavors and they are all made from scratch! I had the rhubarb flavor, it was refreshing. I would not add that onto my favorite flavor list, but it was something different. I really wish I had gotten a more cream-based popsicle though. The rhubarb was more of a icicle/fruit juice consistency and would melt quite fast. I do not bite into my popsicles, because I have slightly sensitive teeth, but a cream-based popsicle would be a bit easier to finish. My next trip here, I will go for a cream-based flavor. Parking/street area: The entrance to this shop is a bit narrow and limited in space due to other restaurants located around the area. I am not from Birmingham, so it was not easy to know exactly where the shop is at."
102,9/7/2016,Jia B.,homewood,5,"Steel city pops is the best! My first thought when I heard of steel city pops was ""Really??? Popsicles??? I would rather have ice cream..."". Well boy was I wrong! While I'm still an ice cream lover, Popsicles now have a place in my heart. They have creamy flavors and fruity flavors and are perfect for any time of day.  They rotate their flavors but they will always have something that sounds delicious. My personal favorite is the vanilla chocolate chip cookie pop, which is pretty much cookie dough covered in vanilla (so an improved cookie dough ice cream). The prices are very affordable ($3.50 for the basic flavors and $4.50 for the cookie pops). I highly recommend trying Steel city pops! You won't be disappointed! Popsicles -- 5 starsPrice -- 5 starsService -- 4 starsAtmosphere -- 4 stars"
103,5/2/2017,Georgia H.,homewood,5,What an amazing Birmingham born company! I love this place (probably because Alabama is hot 11 out of 12 months). I have had at least 6 different flavors that they have all made me want to come back for more. My favorite? Sweet Potato that comes out for a short time in the fall. But some runners up would be coffee and cantaloupe. Really take your pick and you probably won't be disappointed!
104,3/14/2017,Mandy M.,homewood,5,"Anytime we are looking for a sweet treat, we pop in steel city pops! The sweet tea pop tastes just like a glass of sweet tea; it's sweet, but not syrupy. The lemon cream pop is my personal favorite. It is creamy with lots of lemon zest has just enough tart lemon flavor. There are several exotic flavors that we have not ventured out enough to try, like buttermilk. The staff is always friendly and helpful! Highly recommend!"
105,5/16/2017,Savy S.,homewood,5,So many varieties of Popsicles and each one is delicious! I recently tried the lime and the honeydew popsicles. So good. They're a little pricey for popsicles tho ($3) but definitely tasty.
106,12/3/2016,Katie T.,homewood,5,"Steel City Pops is a must-visit when coming to Birmingham.  Their popsicles are homemade, reasonably priced, and they have both fruity and creamy menus with multiple flavors on each. They rotate their flavors and have seasonal ones as well.  My personal favorites are the Buttermilk, caramel, and seasonal Horchata, both of which taste like ice cream!  The creamy ones are more decadent and the fruity pops are good for a light summer day.  The staff is friendly and will give you honest opinions of their pops.  Treat yourself and stop by Steel City Pops!"
107,5/8/2017,Geena F.,homewood,5,"This is a great little find in Birmingham, AL.  If you like super sweet, you can get it dipped in milk, dark, or white chocolate.  If you like it fruity, get a pineapple or strawberry vibe.  They've got it all!"
108,7/10/2017,Morgan E.,homewood,5,"My first experience at Steel City Pops started nearly 5 years ago when I was passing through Birmingham. I got their Arnold Palmer Pop. Now, all those years later I pay a weekly homage since I live here to get a cool summer treat to escape the smoldering heat and humidity. If this is your first time I would strongly encourage trying any of there fresh fruity flavors. If your more of an ice cream fan I would recommend trying when if there cookie pops. They are delicious!"
109,9/1/2016,Marlin S.,homewood,5,Popsicles. Are amazingly good! They have all kinds of flavors. very surprised at how good they were. Worth every penny. Makes you feel young again. I will definitely put on the go back again list.
110,1/14/2016,Ray D.,homewood,5,"So you've heard of mexican La Palatera or ice cream shops, this is like the modern version of that.Excellent Popsicle, organic, non-gmo, gluten free cake pop kind of Popsicle, and they are so delicious. I had the gingerbread cheesecake and let me tell you I ate it in like 3 seconds basically inhaled it. The shop smells so good like a bakery and has a beautiful interior with TV's to tell you whats up, the outside is also legit and looks sweet. If you need espresso after go next door to Octane, excellent little shopping center for snacks."
111,6/4/2016,Scott H.,homewood,4,"Variety of flavors. It is a great alternate to the loaded calorie ice cream, like Breusters. The bars are reasonably priced and did i mention delicious. Usually not a wait, but if it is, it is a small one. Stop by this location, which I have been told is the original one."
112,6/29/2017,Saarah G.,homewood,4,"got recommended by a friend and easily became a must-have every time we travel through. the past couple of times ive been staff has always been super helpful and friendly, but this most previous time everyone working just seemed like they were having a bad day and made the atmosphere uncomfortable. but absolutely in love with everything ive tried and always enjoy taking newbies to try it out too. prices are affordable for the quality you get. tip:not much seating inside, so sometimes it gets a little crowded unless you take it outside!"
113,7/27/2015,Bruce K.,homewood,4,"Man, I wanted that Jalapeno pop. But they didn't have it. So I fell back to a regular Vanilla Bean and ate it as I drove back to the hotel. And it's a good thing I did as it was very melty even in an air-conditioned car!Tasty with a strong vanilla flavor and scent. Absolutely delish."
114,3/20/2017,Alexandria E.,homewood,4,"I LOOOOOVE their strawberry cheesecake pop the pieces of cake in the bar was so good and unexpected on my first try, Overall the ice cream is fresh and they have a big variety of flavors that they rotate during the year. Also as if you can get a validation card so after 10 pops you get one free"
115,10/22/2016,A. S.,homewood,5,So good! I got the fig and cheese pop with caramel drizzle and graham cracker crumbs on it. Would definitely go back because I saw so many other delicious looking flavors!!
116,6/9/2015,Will B.,homewood,5,"It is hard to say a relatively new business is a Birmingham institution. But Steel City Pops has achieved that claim. But sad as it may seem, I had never tried it... until now!So I'm not a huge sweets person. So I would never run out of my way for a dessert type of thing. But with family coming into town and wanting a ""Birmingham treat"", making the trip here was well worth while. I got the plain chocolate. But there was nothing plain about it. How they manage to make all of their pops (even the fruity ones) creamy and not icy... I may never know.Its either how well they freeze them, or how fast you eat them, but you don't have to worry about melty stuff dripping down your hand. The inside is unique and simple. Much like their pops. A must do in Birmingham... especially in this heat."
117,7/7/2016,Kathryn D.,homewood,5,"This is a Magic City classic. The pops are always tasty and the service always genial. Bring guests from out of town and be the ultimate hostess(or host) with the mostest (my mother, friends, etc always rave about this place and it's first on their list of places they want to go when they come back into town). I'm partial to the off-beat flavors because I'm a weirdo: buttermilk is my absolute fave (it tastes like cheesecake, no joke), avocado or pineapple-jalepeno are close seconds and the christmas flavors each year never fail to disappoint. Keep your eyes peeled for their cart around town which is always a welcome respite on a hot day!"
118,1/1/2016,Christine Y.,homewood,5,"Let me start this review by saying (pleading!) that Steel City Pops open a location in Austin, TX. Ever since I tried my first popsicle here a couple of years ago on a holiday visit to Birmingham, I've been dreaming of pops.Their flavors are always changing, with a few best sellers as staples (ex: coffee). I like knowing that I can come in to try a new flavor OR get my favorite one from last time. The owner told us that they make their popsicles fresh daily and with real ingredients.Overall, it's clear that this is an honest business doing what they love...and hoping to make the community a better place one pop at a time. A+ from me and you have my loyalty for the rest of my popsicle-eating life."
119,1/16/2017,Will T.,homewood,5,"This is a pretty good restaurant. You can get you all kindsa pahps. They got chaerry pahps, lemon pahps, nanner pahps, cimmanon pahps. You can get you whatever kinda pahp you want. Don't nobody care. I got me a cookies and cream pahp, a niller pahp, and a chaerry pahp. They was some good pahps. They ain't got no cokecola and ain't got no cokecola pahp neither. You maybe has to go too MacDontalds to get you a colecola after eatin all them pahps. Over all pretty good pahps."
120,7/12/2016,Mike D.,homewood,5,"I'm old and this was my daughters idea.  We are from San Diego and she goes to camp in Mentone so all her friends from camp tell her she has to go to Steel City Pops.  We make plans to drive to Birmingham and spend the day seeing the sights including Steel City Pops.  I have to say I was impressed.  I had the cookie variety with chocolate chips.  It was pretty darn awesome.  We all loved our choices and we got a t-shirt for only $20 (JK about the only) and some free stickers.  The place is packed and everybody seems happy.  Customer service is awesome.  Original location is the way to go.   Last thing this place needs is another 5 star review, but had to give it to them."
121,11/18/2015,Justin W.,homewood,5,"I used to not want to buy in to the hype of a glorified popsicle....but I changed my mind!!These popcicles are so good, and I will gladly drop a few dollars on them from time to time for a delicious, fresh cold treat."
122,5/30/2016,Catherine A.,homewood,5,"This is a great Birmingham institution. One the things I look forward to each season is the new Steel City Pops flavor menu. I have tried everything from the weird to the standard to the brilliant. They lost the calories for all of their pops for everyone calorie counting and wanting a sweet treat. And they separate their flavors by fruity and creamy. I love the mango, the cucumber lime, the avocados, the buttercream, the raspberry lemonade, the sweet potato pecan, the tamarind, the coffee, almost all of them! The beauty of this place is if you try a pop and find you don't like it, you can switch it out for another flavor. They will also dip any pop in chocolate for you to (pro-tip: the buttercream pop dipped in chocolate tastes like cheesecake!). Having a Steel City Pop is a regular part of our days out or nights out or whenever we happen to be near one. Trust me, this shop has a flavor for everyone and will never disappoint."
123,8/7/2015,Jessica A.,homewood,4,"After a visit to the Birmingham Botanical Gardens, my hubby and I REALLY needed a cold treat. After doing a Yelp search for froyo in the area, I found this place and thought, 'why not?'For my fellow northerners, this place is a popsicle bar. Seriously. I kid you not. You can get popsicles and bottles of water and that's it. But here's the thing--they make everything in-house, and these babies are WAAAY better than anything you will get in the frozen aisle. My husband and I both ordered the blueberry basil. If I had been thinking, I would have ordered something different to give a more thorough report, but, oh well... We both loved, loved, loved them! The berry and basil flavors were both super intense. I am not generally a frozen treat person, but I had to stop myself from going and ordering another one. The offerings range from plant-based (blueberry-basil, strawberry, lime, pineapple, watermelon) to creamy (caramel, coffee, vanilla bean) and even a cookie and brownie flavor. The most intriguing to me was the hibiscus popsicle. Next time, I guess!Only one thing to take off that fifth star: the parking lot at this place is tiny and was full when we got there, and the cross street is really narrow, which makes traffic a bit chaotic. There is a big weirdly-shaped gravel area across the street, but no spaces marked. Not the most convenient location to get to, but worth dodging cars. ;)To be honest, if I weren't visiting a friend, I don't think I ever would have had a reason to go to Birmingham. But we had a great day in the city and when we go back, there is no question that we will be seeking out the closest Steel City Pops."
124,8/15/2015,Jerry H.,homewood,5,"This place is poppin'!If you're in the area looking for a quick treat, Steel CIty Pops is the place to go. I'm not a huge fan of popsicles in general, but the pops you get here are so so delicious. I got a caramel popsicle but also tried some of a coffee brownie and cherry sour cream pop. The caramel was so rich and creamy, yet strangely refreshing at the same time (which was great)! The coffee brownie had parts of a brownie embedded in it, which offered a nice surprise and complemented the cold creamy part of the popsicle. At three bucks a pop, I thought the price was actually pretty decent for how substantive the popsicles actually felt/tasted.A 5 star yelp review is a pretty big deal in my book. Steel City Pops is a pretty big deal. Try it!"
125,1/3/2017,Lilly S.,homewood,5,"Great flavors!!  We tried strawberry lemonade, coffee, and vanilla bean flavors. Coffee was the best among all.  We will definitely return for more flavors next time."
126,5/23/2017,K B.,homewood,5,"I can say without hesitation this will be the BEST pop cycle you will ever eat. I've had grapefruit cookie, lemon cream dipped in milk chocolate, Buttermilk ( which is a bit like cheesecake ), rhubarb and a few others. I've taken them home (2 hrs away) and go out of my way to stop by the Huntsville or Bham store. My daughter wants a Steel City Pop cart at her wedding!!! Few ingredients, natural and delicious. From tangy and tart to sweet and creamy.  If you don't like your pop just tell them and you will be given another flavor! Great concept, just wish they were more readily available  but that's my problem not theirs. LOVE THESE frozen treats and you will too!"
127,7/29/2015,Rikesha F.,homewood,4,"A great place to eat a cold treat! This place really brings out the inner kid in me. I've tried the vanilla bean and the lemonade pops and both were yummy. I also had the chocolate covered strawberry when they were doing the dip-in-chocolate thing for an extra $1.00 last summer. All were very good. The vanilla bean melted quicker because it's milk based. The other flavors I tried were more solid. No worries though because that's what you get here in the south when you eat a Popsicle in 100 degree heat. A melty mess. But it was a good melty mess. Try them out. They also have more exotic flavors like jalapeño something, but I like to stay with the regular flavors."
128,9/3/2016,Donielle W.,homewood,5,"I've only been here this once, but WOW! I saw the Coffee pop and then the cashier told me that it was made with Octane coffee and I was SOLD!!!! I will be returning to see if the other pops measure up to that one."
129,5/23/2016,Teacha S.,homewood,5,These pops are amazing. We tried the Amaretta Cream and the Strawberry Lemonade and was ready to order more.
130,8/9/2015,Donna A.,homewood,5,"Great place to cool down on a hot summer day. They even have street carts around town. Choose between puréed fruit pops and creamy type pops. I always go for the fruit ones. Watermelon and strawberry are my favorites- very simple, straightforward, and delicious. There is a parking lot here so it is easy to get to, and they have some minimalist bar seating inside. This should definitely be a stop on your trip to bham!"
131,5/12/2017,Jeffrey A.,homewood,5,"Was moving my son home from his freshman year at Samford University and had to stop in for our last ""Pop"" until next time. Oh My Word!!! Coconut dredged in dark chocolate...a frozen treat straight from the desert bar in heaven."
132,5/1/2017,A M.,homewood,5,Came here for the first time last week. I was in the Birmingham area for the day and looked to Yelp to help me find a cool snack on a hot day. I only tried the buttermilk pop but it was two thumbs up! The young lady at the register let me know they will be expanding to Atlanta soon which is great news because I live in Atlanta and would love to have that buttermilk pop again!
133,7/11/2014,Rose L.,homewood,5,"You know when you eat a good popsicle, it leaves a hit of summer on your tongue. All I can say is Steel City Pops is doing it right for the perfect summer treats! Whether you enjoy a more ""ice cream"" (cream) geared popsicle or the original fruit flavor, they've got you covered. I was lucky enough to visit the pop shop with five family members who love to share, so I got to try the vanilla, chocolate, coffee, guava and my own choice, the blood orange. They were all fantastic but I would have to say the fruit flavors were definitely my personal favorite and would recommend both the blood orange and guava, although it definitely depends what you're in the mood for. The cream pops taste just like ice cream on a stick and the flavor is delightful. While the ""fruity"" pops have the perfect balance of sweet and sour; the combination makes for a summer afternoon snack that hits the spot. If you're touring the city, take one to go and eat it while you check out the Vulcan, botanical gardens or just take in the city. They have rotating flavors along with the staple flavors and while you may think $2.75 for a pop is pricey, it's 100% worth it and if you love a deal you can get a punch card where your 11th single pop is free or your 11th bag of four is free. I can guarantee you, you won't be sorry stopping by."
134,3/29/2016,Jim A.,homewood,4,"Pineapple Jalapeño popsicles. Yes please.  Been here multiple times and it continues to be good every time.  The creamy ones are good, the fruity ones are good, and yes! The savory ones are good too.I love stopping in here and getting a four pack for the nieces and nephews.  Can't wait to get back and try a new flavor. It will be hard to not order pineapple Jalapeño though.  I'm waiting for one with basil as well.  Bring it!"
135,7/24/2016,Marcus D.,homewood,5,Drove from Atlanta to Birmingham just for a pop!! Took my girlfriend and two friends and we took bags to go home with more pops!! The fruit flavors are my favorite!!
136,2/1/2015,Lisa H.,homewood,5,"Deliciousness atop a wooden oblong! It's wonderful how SCP has a mix of unique flavor offerings and classics. Take the mayhaw pop. I never even knew such a fruit existed but now I'm a more knowledgeable person, thanks to Steel City. I don't know if I have a favorite; there are so many notable flavors. Some that are tops in my book include caramel, buttermilk, blackberry, avocado, strawberry balsamic, and carrot cake.Love the loyalty/punch card. Great customer service. Once the sweet tea pop fell apart on me, and they kindly replaced it. My pop pal wasn't too wild about the spruce, so he got a different flavor option, no questions asked. I prefer the Homewood shop to the Summit since a) it's the original, b) they make the pops there, and c) the seating area is slightly less cramped. If you come at the right time, you can see youngsters making the magical treats from scratch. The parking situation has vastly improved since the rustic lot opened across the street.I wish the electronic chalkboard would be updated when a flavor sells out. Sometimes I've finally settled on a selection only to find out it's gone. Oh mango, you will be mine eventually! So stoked for a location to open in Auburn!"
137,6/12/2016,Anna H.,homewood,5,"The champagne white tea flavor is my favorite, but I've honestly never had one that isn't good! So many good options! Great for kids and adults!"
138,6/26/2016,Kyme R.,homewood,5,Loved! I thought we were going to an ice cream place so I was thrown off a bit when we walked in but we decided to try one creamy and one fruit. Im a chocolate girl usually but my husband had the creamy Vanilla and it was the best! I'll definitely be back when we travel to Birmingham again.
139,8/13/2016,Rob D.,homewood,5,"We used to stop here often when family still lived in Birmingham. What's not to like? Homemade pops, unique flavors, good prices, and a big selection. This location is always busy especially on Friday and Sat nights. Definitely recommended!"
140,3/25/2016,Karen T.,homewood,5,"ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I had the Coconut and it was superb! After a really disappointing lunch at The Little Donkey, this yummy popcycle raised my spirits and made my tummy happy again! Thanks!"
141,10/5/2015,Brendie W.,homewood,5,"Amazing!! I had the buttermilk. It's fresh, and so delish. Go,go,go. That's all I can say. It's that good!! Please come to Greensboro, NC!!!"
142,7/9/2014,John Mark D.,homewood,5,"If you're looking for a frozen treat, this is the place to go in Birmingham. I've been a huge fan of this place since their grand opening. You're not buying into the hype? Let me help.This is the original location (there are now three in Birmingham and other locations elsewhere in the state and I believe they are franchising in Texas). The idea here is simple. Gourmet popsicles made with organic fruit and organic cane sugar. This is not cheap, off brand popsicles that you can find in the frozen food aisle at the grocery store. This is the real deal. I've heard people complain about the three dollar price tag on these pops. My take is that you're going to spend just as much if not more on any almost frozen treat in town except for cheap soft serve.If you can get over the price you will not be able to get over the insanely amazing taste of their fruit or creamy pops. I've tried just about every flavor here and I've not been disappointed. They have classic staples such as chocolate or watermelon and off the wall flavors such as pineapple jalapeño, cherry sour cream, and blueberry basil. The menu is always changing so if you drop by any time of the year you will find something new and intriguing to enjoy. In conclusion, don't miss out on these great flavors and dessert vibes."
143,10/12/2015,Matt H.,homewood,5,"Great pops. There is a good selection of flavors. Some are pretty unusual. I ordered a Caramel pop, which oddly enough I've never seen available at our local pop shops. My daughter had a Carrot Cake pop which was reportedly the best order. My wife had a Smoked Fig with cheese which was great, but she and my daughter preferred the Carrot Cake.Great pops. Friendly staff. Eclectic little area. I would definitely go back!I had no idea this was a chain, but the website shows them in several locations in Alabama and Texas."
144,10/15/2015,K R.,homewood,4,Really unique! I live up north so having a full time Popsicle shop year round is such a fun and unique concept. They have some traditional flavors and some really crazy ones that I would not have thought of as a dessert. I decided to try the Carmel dipped in chocolate. It was a great combination but the chocolate doesn't stay on for long. The chocolate had a strong coconut flavor and although it was good it over powered the Carmel. The chocolate has coconut oil in it which is why it hardens after dipping. We also tried the peanut butter and chocolate dipped in chocolate. If you try the dipped option I suggest eating it there! I think this place is great and I hope they find success throughout the south. They even have to go options for people they put in a freezer bag with a cold pack. So cool!!
145,7/1/2016,David K.,homewood,4,"I'm the guy that always said I would never pay $3 for a popsicle. That is until I went by Steel City Pops. The Pineapple Jalapeño was amazing. Tt was cold and hot at the same time, it was delicious. I also tried the strawberry creme.  Fresh ingredients make the difference here. I am ok wanting in line that is all the way into the parking lot because it's worth."
146,8/12/2015,Jacky V.,homewood,5,"I just want a popsicle from Steel City Pops every day day of my life! I think I have tried almost all of them. Here is my ranking in greatness:1. Coconut- it's like a tropical flavor bomb in your month! 2. Pineapple jalapeño (I had this is Dallas)3. Strawberry Basil4. Watermelon5. Strawberry shortcake- dude, there is cake inside.I don't discriminate... I love um all!"
147,11/3/2014,Stephen W.,homewood,5,"Who would have thought that a place that sells popsicles would get a 5 star review from me?!  I really enjoy the popsicles here and make it a point to stop in whenever I am in the area.  The people are really nice and if you dont like the flavor you get they will replace it for free!  If they have carrot cake in stock when you are there try it, even if you do not think you will like it.  It is amazing!Parking can be a bit of a pain :-\"
148,3/25/2016,Kenzie T.,homewood,5,Stop whatever you're doing and go get yourself a popsicle from this place! They are to die!!! I had the toasted marshmallow and was actually impressed with how authentic is tasted. Each Popsicle was about $3 which is a bit expensive but most definitely worth it.
149,12/12/2015,Cat A.,homewood,5,"I am a fan! Every season when the flavors change, I have to try all the new ones. If you try a flavor you don't like, they'll switch it out for one you do like. I've only had one pop I didn't like there, but when I went to try and purchase a new pop instead of finishing that one, they wouldn't let me pay and just gave me a different flavor.This is really a gem in Birmingham and a must try for anyone living or visiting the area. It's a great end to a date or a day out or just because."
150,8/11/2015,Debbie C.,homewood,4,I lost count how many times I've been there...and every single time I forget to get my loyalty card stamped! Pretty sure I could have gotten a free pop by now. Awesome variety and quick. They do run out of their more popular flavors. I like to buy a pop box so I don't have to run out there just to get a pop fix. Parking can be a hassel towards  mid-day and evening hours because it shares the lot with Little Donkey and Octane (both of which you should make a stop at!)
151,12/17/2016,Christine F.,homewood,5,"These popsicles are insanely tasty and with new flavors coming out throughout the seasons, there is no way you won't want to keep coming back for more! Simply delicious!"
152,7/23/2015,Svetlana J.,homewood,5,"Fell in love with this place since day one, and I will always have a love for this wonderful little popsicle shop! The pina colada pop was my latest order, but I did love a strawberry vinaigrette one they used to make in the past- wondering where it went off to. The fresh ingredients you cannot beat. Worth skipping those grocery store pops for a nice summer treat!"
153,7/8/2014,Janece M.,homewood,5,"I finally dropped in to try Steel City Pops during the 4th of July holiday break. My best friend and I tried the Caramel and Vanilla Bean pops. All I can say is that we left the shop and headed to Homewood Park and raced to eat our insanely delicious pops before they melted in the sweltering heat! The taste and novelty of the shop and its creative pops left me reminiscing on the summers of my childhood and with a hunger to try more of the flavors. The current creamy flavor offerings include: Avocado, Banana, Buttermilk, Caramel, Chocolate,Cherry Sour Cream, Coconut, Coffee, Peanut Butter, and Vanilla Bean. Fruity flavors include: Blood Orange, Blueberry Basil, Cantaloupe, Guava, Hibiscus, Lemonade, Pineapple, Strawberry, Strawberry Balsamic, and Watermelon. I can't wait to try more of them."
154,3/2/2014,Vasu M.,homewood,5,"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet, considering it is one of my favorite places in Birmingham!There is nothing that cheers me up more than a steel city pop. It is the perfect dessert in my opinion. Light, refreshing, tasty, sweet, and portion controlled. I have tried several flavors = coconut, coffee, peanut butter, pink peppercorn, buttermilk, caramel, avocado, chocolate peanut butter, pear, raspberry lemon, mango, strawberry balsamic and the list goes on! I have never been disappointed with any of the flavors I've gotten. But the buttermilk will always reign as my favorite! Highly recommend it!Other than the delicious pops, I love the interior and design of this place. I also give them 5 stars for customer service. If you are unsure of a flavor, they always offer to swap it out for a different flavor if you don't like it. That gives me the comfort to go outside the box sometimes.If you haven't gone to steel city pops, add it to your list of things to do ASAP!"
155,4/9/2016,Bailey B.,homewood,4,"Really excellent pops, both the fruity and the creamy.  We tried the strawberry lemonade and the chocolate brownie cookie pops.  The strawberry tasted strongly of, well, strawberry and lemonade!  The flavors were clear, fresh, and delicious.  The chocolate brownie cookie pop will make you thirsty, but it is fantastic--a medium-thick layer of frozen chocolate goodness on top of a hunk of gooey brownie.  My only complaint is that the pops are expensive.  3 bucks for a normal and 4.25 for a cookie pop.  I think 2.50 and 3 dollars would be more reasonable.  But hey, people are willing to buy at that price, so why not sell at that price?"
156,8/23/2015,Shannon T.,homewood,5,I love that Popsicles are so simple and here so simply delicious. Great flavors. Wonderful summer cool off. I really enjoy the 280 location as well coming back from the lake.
157,6/25/2014,Laura D.,homewood,5,"We stopped for a pop, left with 4 more in a complimentary freezer bag, and stopped for 4 more on the way to the airport the next day. :) Come to FL, I think we could single-handedly keep you in business!Each pop was equally delicious and full of yummy fresh ingredients. Loved the unique variety of flavors! We were hesitant to order buttermilk but were soooo glad we did. Also loved the guava pop. My baby is teething so we gave him a taste-then he got mad because he wanted more.Definitely recommend Steel City Pops!"
158,3/14/2016,Wesley W.,homewood,5,Love the place. Buttermilk is a must. Not near as disgusting as it sounds. My son was like Remy off of Ratatouille   when he first combined Strawberries and Cheese
159,5/23/2015,Mustafa F.,homewood,4,This place rocks!! The wait is sometimes a little long to get in due to the long line but worth it. The Fort Worth location seems to be a little nicer than the Dallas one but overall it's amazing. The cream ones are really good and so are the fruit ones. The fruit ones do melt a little faster than the creams but if you eat it fast enough it is worth it
160,3/12/2016,Margaret L.,homewood,5,"I'm not from anywhere near this place but this place was great! The atmosphere is extremely welcoming, I love the location of the shop with a nice coffee shop next door. The popsicles were amazing. I never would have thought to eat a cucumber and lime popsicle but it was the best!! The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Next time I'm in Birmingham I'll definitely have to stop for a treat here! Love it."
161,2/22/2016,Debbie M.,homewood,5,"Love Steel City Pops! We bought 350 pops as a fundraiser for our youth group and sold them all. Not one complaint from our customers. In fact, they came back for 2nd and 3rd pops. My personal favorites are coconut, coffee and strawberry lemonade. I take my grandchildren here and they don't rush them to select a flavor. I like that. They have a webpage with flavors listed but each location also has others that aren't listed. Try them, you won't be disappointed."
162,3/6/2014,Kylea C.,homewood,5,"I'm sitting here drinking a mint green tea which reminded me to write a review on this place. My boyfriend and I popped in here for the first time last weekend and were really happy we did. To begin with, it's in a great location in Homewood. We grabbed our Popsicles and were able to walk across the street and peruse around the park and stop into little local shops while we enjoyed them. I can't speak for all the flavors because we both got the orange mint green tea (hence why I was reminded to write this) and it was SO good. It tasted fresh and organic- literally nothing like the Popsicles you find in the frozen aisle of the grocery store. We will absolutely be back. I've got my eye on that peanut butter one."
163,11/5/2015,Anne W.,homewood,5,"You think you've had a Popsicle and then you come to this place! They offer so many amazing flavors. My favorite is the butter cream ( I believe this is what it was called) regardless, I wish I could open a franchise out here in AZ because it would be a HIT!  If you are in Alabama- Steel City Pops is where it's at!"
164,2/8/2014,Max F.,homewood,5,"Cool place, cold treats, chill people. I've been impressed by a good it can be a simple popsicle. They come in a big variety of flavors and pretty much all of them are special. Good deal!"
165,5/31/2015,Helen S.,homewood,3,"I've only tried their passionfruit pop...twas just frozen juice. I was kinda hoping for something with a texture more like frozen sorbet on a stick. Totally not worth $3 for one, I may try their creamy ones in the future to see if they're any better and re-review."
166,12/7/2015,Brittanie A.,homewood,5,"Best frozen treats ever. These are a staple to the residents of Birmingham, and anyone visiting should definitely try one.. or two. There are all kinds of different awesome flavors. My recommendation is most definitely ""buttermilk""... or if it is available- ""cherry sour cream""."
167,2/24/2013,Alan B.,homewood,5,"The short of this review is that Steel City Pops is awesome! A must try!For one reason or another I had not been able to try them for months and then one fateful day I saw their cart while at the Summit. I nearly wrecked trying to get my car pulled over as fast as possible.  I was like a kid running for the ice cream truck! My wife got a big kick out of it. Needless to say after that first experience I was hooked.Although they offer consistent staple flavors, many change seasonally depending on what ingredients are freshly available.  Many flavors speak directly to the feelings, emotions and traditions of the seasons and our local culture.  There is obviously a lot of thought, care and passion put into these ""tasty treats"".Flavor standouts; Buttermilk (Tastes like the best cheesecake you've ever had), Sweet Tea (makes you long for a hot summer's day kicked back in the shade), Coffee (Rich, Creamy and ever so slightly gritty with the a few ground coffee beans), Coconut, Eggnog, Peanut Butter, etc. etc. etc. So many great flavors! There is truly something for everybody. Whether you're in Homewood or at the Summit or wherever a cart may be, take the time to plan a stop and avoid almost wrecking your car (like I almost did :/) in an attempt to partake in these oh so delicious treats."
168,7/5/2015,Katie S.,homewood,3,"If you're looking for a unique experience, this is the place for you. The shop itself is small, but the strange treats that are offered are overwhelming. I went with the avocado pop, while my boyfriend stuck to the plain ol' vanilla. Both were fantastic! It was a bit pricey, honestly. I'd give it a $$ out of $$$$. I understand that it's a cool quality popsicle, but I wish I could come here all the time."
169,9/6/2012,Ashley W.,homewood,5,"I'll be honest with you - I am so sick of self-serve frozen yogurt.There. I said it. I love ice cream/fro-yo as much as the next person, but I'm just tired of the concept I think.That being said, I was so excited to try out Steel City Pops when a friend raved about them. Unique popsicles? I'm totally there. I wanted to be a little adventurous so I got the strawberry balsamic flavor. Wow! What a great flavor combination that I wouldn't have thought of on my own. Super refreshing, oddly tangy, and exactly what I wanted on a hot Birmingham day. My husband got the orange cream popsicle and really enjoyed it. I definitely want to try avocado and pineapple jalapeno in the near future!My one compliant is that the store front is very little and the parking around it isn't the best. The Friday afternoon that my husband I went the line was out the door. I definitely don't mind kids at all, but it seemed like a zoo because 1) the store was so small and 2) there were so many kids/moms at one time. This wasn't a big deal but next time we might try to time it so we're not there at a popular time (right after lunch)."
170,6/3/2016,Josiah T.,homewood,5,Excellent! Really unique flavors(i.e avacado) along with more traditional ones. They taste amazing and spot on. Definitely a nice treat on a hot day!
171,7/3/2014,Jeremy B.,homewood,5,My first time at this location! I've been to the location at the Summit. The Popsicles taste homemade  I got the chocolate Popsicle and it tastes so creamy. Never had a Popsicle this good. My coworker and I went to this new location and because we were soldiers they shockingly have us free Popsicles. I commend them for their unexpected gesture of kindness. We'll be sure to keep patronizing your business! I love a good business!
172,5/21/2012,Courtney A.,homewood,5,"Holy Popsicle! Steel City Pops is incredible!Inspired by Nashville-based Las Paletas, owner Jim Watkins, has created a truly unique experience in Birmingham and I'm looking forward to seeing this business grow. Their storefront is located in Homewood (next to Little Donkey) but they will also have carts at local parks and farmer's markets. The storefront is well designed, including an open kitchen, where you can see the popsicles being created in front of you. Only all-natural, organic ingredients are used to create two different kinds of pops: creamy or fruity.I tried the hibiscus (fruity) pop today and it was incredible - truly one of a kind! I'm considering going back this afternoon to try another flavor. Trust me, you don't want to miss out on this place. Treat yourself to a pop today!"
173,8/10/2013,Lee C.,homewood,4,"People rave about Steel City Pops for good reason.  The whole experience is great, and the popsicles are amazing.  But, they are very expensive.We arrived about 8:30PM on Friday night, and the place was hopping.   Lots of younger folks eating popsicles.  We were immediately greeted by the clerks when we entered and got two popsicles within minutes.  Paid by credit card.  The strawberry popsicle tasted much like a strawberry daiquiri, and was obviously made from real ingredients.  Excellent.  I had the cucumber lime popsicle.  It was very sweet and had a slightly strange taste and texture--clearly made from cucumbers and lime juice.  Still, it was good.We ate outside, and the popsicles melted quickly, leading to messy hands and arms.  I don't remember having any napkins around.Overall, we had a pleasant experience and enjoyed the popsicles.  The cost is the only consideration.   Highly recommended."
174,7/25/2012,Chris G.,homewood,5,"Okay. I've heard all the hype and have always been skeptical. I took a colleague there today and the line stretched out the door. At 2:30. On a 95-degree day. So I approached the counter and ordered a lemon raspberry popsicle (Trust me, there are plenty of much more exotic offerings such as strawberry & balsamic vinegar, but I was  feeling cautious). OMG. Like foodgasm. Worth every single bite."
175,8/2/2013,Eunice T.,homewood,3,"Friends and family have been raving about this popsicle shop since it opened. Keep telling me how ""New York"" it is.Well, it is pretty hipster with odd flavor combos that seem to work. I tried the hibiscus and the much anticipated maple bacon. Hibiscus delicious. Maple bacon....eh. The bacon was good. The whole popsicle itself just wasn't amazing. Love the steel city theme decor and the painted picture if Vulcan. I can see Steel City being a relief on those 95+ degree days."
176,6/9/2015,Meg K.,homewood,5,All I can say is Yes! Heaven for a gluten free girl. Caramel was great. Also chocolate brownie
177,7/5/2014,Steve A.,homewood,5,"Of you haven't been here,  you're missing out.  We go every time we come to Birmingham. Gourmet popsicles are made out in the open kitchen so you can watch, in the funky and fun atmosphere.  Strawberry Balsamic,  Blueberry Basil,  Peanut Butter,  Avocado...only a few of the flavors found there,  and they change often. Definitely worth stopping for!"
178,5/25/2014,David L.,homewood,5,"After upscale froyo, cupcakes, and pies, popsicles might be just ridiculous enough to be the next ""thing."" I must admit these are like no other popsicle I have had. The coffee flavor was rich, creamy and stayed surprisingly stable as I ate it indoors. In other words, it wasn't icy and drippy like the ones of my childhood. It's also refreshing that this was thought up in the South rather than New York or Los Angeles."
179,2/5/2014,Tilia M.,homewood,2,"I got the pear variety, and I gotta say, I wasn't wowed. There were lots and lots of seeds in my pop, making the texture gritty and grainy the whole way through. I finally had to throw it away. Not a fan."
180,7/16/2013,Will L.,homewood,4,"The popularity of this place is unquestioned.  It makes perfect sense.  We all love sweets and nobody is more creative than these guys.  They've taken a classic treat that we all have fond childhood memories of and put a twist on it.  A delicious twist.What is mystifying, is how they stay so busy all year around.  It can be thirty degrees outside and there will be thirty customers lined up all the way down the sidewalk.  Why? Because of flavors like Sweet Tea, Hibiscus, Coffee, and Maple Syrup and Bourbon.Treat your self.  You deserve it."
181,3/18/2014,Jacob W.,homewood,5,"These are so delicious. My favorites are the Buttermilk, Caramel, and Coconut. It's not just the flavors though, you can tell by the texture that these pops are handcrafted with a special recipe.Birmingham has scored big with these little delights."
182,6/17/2013,Keith C.,homewood,5,"So when I first heard about Steel City Pops, I had the same reaction that I'm sure quite a few other people have had - ""why is everybody going crazy over *popsicles*?!""  I mean, it's a *popsicle* folks - sugar water, frozen, on a stick.  But I'm gonna tell you right now, believe. the. hype.  Steel City's work is for reals, son.  Lol.  And I'm going to do you a favor - I'm going to do what no one else seemed to be able to do for me, when I was still lost in the popsicle wilderness.  I'm going to explain to you *exactly* why these things are as great as they are, and why the hype machine is in full-force over them.  So grab your keys and get ready to hit the car after you read this, cuz you're gonna want some just that quick. :DThe magic that is Steel City Pops is three-fold.  The first - nostalgia.  Eating a popsicle in summer is a wonderful reminder of when I was a kid, running like a stoner to the ice cream truck, shoving my money at the driver, and grabbing a cherry popsicle like a breath of oxygen in space.  Those were awesome times, and going to town on a 'sicle just brings those days back.  The second - flavors.  As a kid, although I wasn't complaining, we were stuck with the basics - cherry, lemon, grape, banana, ""blue"".  They were great, true, but there wasn't much variety.  Then Steel City comes along and throws red and white polka-dot suspenders in our black tie affair with flavors like watermelon (which tastes like an actual watermelon, people...if I'm lying I'm dying), blood orange, and *80s-cartoon-eye-bulge* pineapple jalapeño.  What?!  Yeah.  And the flavors list goes on and on.  It's incredible...  Finally, the third - the ""Steel City Secret"".  For the life of me, I don't know how they do it, but it's a HUGE part of why I'm falling in love with these things.  I've only tasted two - mine and the rest of my wife's - but somehow SCP has figured out how to keep the popsicle completely frozen, but yet ""leaky"" at the same time.  By ""leaky"" I mean, the popsicle is juicy but still remains solid as you eat it.  So you end up slurping the entire time you're devouring it, while all the flavor holds your taste buds hostage, with no worries of it falling from the stick.  It's craaaaaazy, but sooooooo good.And that, my friends, is what all the fuss and fanaticism is all about.  Seriously, Steel City Pops is definitely pushing out some great quality teeth-chattering enjoyment, and you owe it to the sticky-faced kid inside you to find out for yourself.  Enjoy!"
183,5/4/2015,Evelyn W.,homewood,5,"Fun stop for dessert, very different concept, healthy!  Lots of choices and cute setting.  Friendly staff!"
184,3/22/2015,Dipali P.,homewood,5,"The vanilla bean, orange cream, and Strawberry cream are awesome. The peach cream is ok. Haven't  had the courage to try more of the exotic flavors."
185,5/2/2015,Marco L.,homewood,5,1st time here at the Homewood location and it's just as amazing I kept it simple and got the strawberry lemonade and it was on point 10 out of 10 would get again
186,9/22/2015,Ruby S.,homewood,5,"Amazing place with so many pops to choose for. I had the strawberry and caramel, both tasted great!! If you are looking for a tasty Popsicle, this is the place to go for."
187,10/15/2012,Christina S.,homewood,5,"Steel City Pops ROCKS!  I hired them to cater a surprise birthday party for MrSS9 (oh, don't you worry - we had more stuff to nosh than just popsicles, but this was a pretty darned cool idea).  So ... The week before the party, I wanted to be sure I was ordering all the correct flavors - and off we went to Steel City Pops (after our lunch at Pinches Tacos!) to get to tastin'.  It was REAL hard for me to keep the secret for starters, but asking him which flavors he liked and trying to keep a straight face was almost impossible.  I did it though, and was able to get out of him three flavors that he thought he might like.  And those three were added to my list.The business owner, JIm helped me tremendously.  He was kind and understanding that I had no idea what I wanted, and he was as genuinely excited about the upcoming birthday celebration as I was.  Now, where would I even start with all those flavor choices?  I gave him my three already ""faved"":  Strawberry Cream, Blueberry and Banana, and then Jim offered a new selection which was FAB U LOUS - Caramel - just so happens to be made with Stone Hollow Farm's goats milk. YUM!  We also ended up with Cucumber Lime, a very fresh, fruity taste, Strawberry Balsamic, which was to DIE for, Pineapple Jalapeno - which will absolutely knock your socks off, and Chocolate Chili which is a creamy flavor of chocolate and chile (not quite as spicy as the pineapple one.    I can tell you that I have tried all eight of those popsicles and each one of them is better than the last - which could get confusing, I know, if you ate them in reverse order.  Let's just go with them all being WONDERFUL! While I loved their little store front in Homewood, I will prefer to enjoy my pops at an event at my house!  I'll get through the minimum - no PROBLEM!"

Updated review",Caleigh R.,homewood,4,"Hibiscus and Chocolate Chili.  Still love CC , but raspberry lemon is definitely better than hibiscus.  Loved introducing more friends to this new hot spot in Homewood!"
190,6/12/2012,Alden C.,homewood,5,"Had the lime popsicle at the Urban Cookhouse Farmer's Market at the Summit and loved it.  Yes, it is an expensive popsicle.  But yes, it is delicious.  I'm a fan of any local business that provides excellent, innovative products and generally elevates the level of Birmingham business/cuisine, and Steel City Pops is doing just that.  With flavors like Avocado and Pineapple Jalapeno, these pops give the traditional yogurt and ice cream shops a run for their money.  Plus, they are mobile.  I am yet to go to their storefront, but I see their cart at every cool local event, where they are surrounded by folks eager to fork over a few dollars for a unique icy treat.  It gets hot in Bham in the summertime, so grab your pops (which apparently will be available in packs of 3 at local groceries sometime soon!) and enjoy- but beware- they will melt so be sure to get multiple napkins to catch the inevitable popsicle drip :)"
191,10/15/2013,Kristen C.,homewood,5,"A Birmingham must. When I visited, I made a trip to Steel City Pops practically every night. The Hibiscus, Avocado, Sweet Tea, Cucumber Lime, and Coffee (used from the coffee next door at Octane) were all so good. Safe to say in addicted."
192,6/15/2012,Whitney B.,homewood,4,"Why have fro-yo when you can have a delicious treat on a stick? I had been eager to try this place because I have been to Las Paletas in Nashville and Meltdown in New Orleans. I knew Birmingham was in for a treat. I have a love for all things spicy. I also have a love for all things sweet. So when you put sweet and spicy together on a popsicle, how could it get any better? So, I was bold and tried the pineapple jalapeno pop. This is where my taste buds piss me off. I can handle some really spicy food. Indian spicy, Chinese spicy, Thai spicy...and these cuisines usually use peppers higher than a stupid jalapeno. But for some reason I just can't handle jalapenos! I even love sriracha sauce, which is made with red jalapenos. Maybe I just don't like green jalapenos. I dunno. So of course, I loved the pineapple flavor of the popsicle, but I couldn't handle the jalapeno flavor. I should have gone with the mango. My boyfriend had the strawberry cream. He liked it, I thought it was ok. But I am not a big strawberry fan. The only downside, is the location. The parking at times can be a nightmare. And for some reason, teeny boppers/hipsters have chosen this area as their new hangout. Frown."
193,10/26/2014,Sam R.,homewood,5,"So delicious!!! I love dessert so a Popsicle doesn't usually cut it for me....but Steel City changed my mind!  I had the sweet potato pecan and my husband had the maple bacon bourbon and both were fantastic!  Rich, creamy, and indulgent in taste.  The two kids working were friendly and more than willing to give their recommendations when making the tough decision between flavors.  Recommend!!"
194,9/19/2012,Gale B.,homewood,5,Best popsicles ever. One bite and you forget you cares. The love and work they put into these creations are evident on first lick. I have had almost one of each flavor. I also love that they have trucks around town to get one outside of the store.Their store however is very worth the trip in. It is simple and industrial. You can watch them make Popsicles. It is almost 2012's answer to the drug store soda fountain.
195,5/26/2012,Amanda S.,homewood,5,"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME! Well, I haven't actually been to the ""place"" but I did have a coconut popsicle out of their cart at Pepper Place---------------and oh. my. goodness. Deliciousness. This will become a must for each time I go to Pepper Place. But lets get real, this is going to be a must for each time I go to Homewood as well. My favorite kind of restaurants are those that are rather unique in atmosphere and also where they push the edge with their food. I can't vouch for their atmosphere since I haven't been to their store (although their store photos of the store on Facebook seem to be really cool), but they most definitely pushed the edge with popsicles. Heck, they reinvented the popsicle! My friend ordered a pineapple jalapeño popsicle (what?!?)  and it was fantastic----and I even hate jalapeño. My creamy coconut popsicle was out of this world. I think I may need to go sample the rest of them now......What makes this place even better is that it's made with all organic ingredients!Keep it up Steel City Pops!"
196,3/9/2014,Rebecca M.,homewood,5,I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I was only in town for three days and I made a point to come back twice. There are so many flavor options but even though it is simple I really like the plain vanilla dipped in white chocolate. I would come everyday if they had a location in Pittsburgh!
197,4/30/2013,Trevvor C.,homewood,4,"Just two words: avocado popsicle. Crazy right? Well try this on for size: chocolate chili.Those are two of the menagerie of flavors offered by the little shop called Steel City Pops. When my wife and I first saw and heard about the place we were incredulous. A place that sells popsicles exclusively? How would that even work for a business that didn't operate out of the back of a quirkly little truck playing annoying music on repeat? Evidently they were spot on - the day we went there was a line to wait in, waaaay out into the parking lot (because there's no room inside to wait) and it stayed there the entire time that we were in line, ordered, and sat and ate our pops in the sunshine.I'll be back, and maybe I'll try the Blood Orange next time around...although that de-licious avocado pop would be hard to pass up."
198,8/29/2015,Thomas A.,homewood,5,Special treat after any meal or activity. New flavors on a stick like a popsicle. Ice cream flavors or fruity.
199,11/12/2012,Brian K.,homewood,5,"I'm fairly confident that King of Pops in Atlanta will forever be the popsicle love of my life - however, if we were to ever have a falling out, Steel City Pops would be my first booty call. This place serves some incredibly flavorful popsicles - and they even have a stationary storefront so you don't have to worry about traipsing around town in the event that you have a hankering for one of their decidedly addictive frozen treats.Pops: Steel City Pops specializes in 100% natural gourmet popsicles, which I'm assuming are affectionately dubbed ""pops"" to avoid any copyright infringement claims by the Unilever Company. The shop offers both fruity and creamy pop creations, all of which are made with natural or certified organic ingredients. The fruity pops are gluten-free, vegan, and have no refined sugars. The flavors rotate based upon availability and season, but the standard repertoire includes approximately 8 fruity flavors and 10 creamy flavors. During my visit, I opted for the banana flavor, which I was told included banana, Mexican cinnamon, lemon, organic cane sugar, organic milk, and cream. The pop was incredibly flavorful and generous in size. Service: All orders are placed at the front counter - the staff removes your selection from the cooler and will also cut-off the plastic wrapper if you choose to dine-in. The place appeared to be overstaffed during my Saturday afternoon visit, but I'm guessing that some of them might have been assigned to the kitchen - nonetheless, they were all friendly and eager to explain the production process and available flavors.Atmosphere: The interior would best be described as industrial chic - the floor plan is simple and functional, yet still inviting. The available seating is restricted to a handful of high-tops stools that line the front window - as such, parties with children, elderly, and/or handicapped individuals should plan accordingly.  Cost: Expensive by traditional popsicle standards, but well worth the cost. Individually wrapped pops are $3 each. Credit/debit cards are accepted via Square. Other: Steel City Pops is closed on Mondays. Hours of operation are 12PM-9PM, Sunday and Tuesday-Thursday, and 12PM-10PM, Friday-Saturday. First time visitors and non-locals may have some difficulty finding this place - although the physical address is Central Ave, the front entrance is actually on Reese St."
200,3/8/2015,Rachel D.,homewood,5,"A Popsicle in March is a hard sell, but these folks drive a hard bargain. The Strawberry Balsamic was very satisfying, and the Sweet Tea pop just made me yearn for a hot day and a glass of lemonade to chase it down. Can't wait to try the others."
201,6/9/2012,Richard R.,homewood,5,"This place is pure perfection on a stick. Bill Cosby will gladly put down his pudding pops for one of these expertly crafted treats. I have tasted about 5 different flavors, and each gets better than the last. I have a special place in my heart for the cream pops which are smooth, creamy, just plain delicious. They serve a creative variety of flavors to satisfy anyone's taste buds. The staff is very friendly, and they are located in a beautifully restored building in Homewood. I know my personal Heaven is catered by Steel City Pops, but I'm glad while I'm still on this Earth, I can enjoy these treats any time I want."
202,5/3/2013,E J M.,homewood,5,Cool flavors of homemade popsicles!  Tamarind and chocolate chili are great.  The peanut butter has peanut chunks at the bottom.  Fun treat!
203,4/28/2014,L B.,homewood,5,"Coconut is delicious.Avocado mostly tastes like lime, but is refreshing!Blueberry basil is amazing and dense with blueberry skins and definitely worth getting even though creamy pops seem more unique than fruity pops"
204,1/8/2014,Eunice C.,homewood,5,"Love this place! Love the vibe, owner was super nice, and the price was just right! $2 for handmade pops, that's a deal. I cannot wait for the opening in Dallas!"
205,1/27/2014,Megan L.,homewood,5,Omg I love this place! Its a great treat. Try the buttermilk! Its like cheesecake popsicle.
206,6/14/2012,Rob T.,homewood,4,This is such a great place to take the kiddos!I absolutely love the Blood Orange pop!Only Recommendation I would give the owners....although I love the use of real fruit....I'd try to sieve a little more of the seeds(blackberry/raspberry) out prior to freezing....
207,3/6/2013,Margot W.,homewood,4,"I have sampled steel city pops back when I lived in bham and I must say that these are some damn fine Popsicles.  I come back from time to time and always try to make it by for a pop.  My personal fav is the lemon cream.  It is smooth, yet pleasantly tart.  You can't go wrong with coconut, blackberry, or  any of the fruit flavors, really.  I've tried the chocolate chili, which was pretty good too.  I like that the ingredients are really simple--usually just fruit, water, and sugar (and cream in some).I give 4 stars, rather than 5, only because I think the prices are a bit high."
208,5/31/2013,Leslie T.,homewood,4,"When I first starting hearing the buzz about Steel City Pops, I have to admit, I didn't understand all the hype.  I thought, ""Uhhhh it's just a popsicle,"" but now I really do love this place.  There is something so wonderful about seeing a Steel City Pops cart at a Birmingham event.  The flavors are delicious and they are a real B'ham success! My only reason for not giving a 5 star is because $3 kind of seems like a lot for a popsicle."
209,6/11/2013,Tiffany L.,homewood,5,"There's something for everyone with fruity flavors like strawberry balsamic, tamarind, hibiscus and blood orange, along with decadent creamy varieties, like peanut butter, chocolate chili and avocado. I went with the buttermilk, because the woman at the front counter said it tasted like cheesecake. It absolutely did, and I was very happy with my choice. There's very little seating, and it looks like parking can be an issue, so I would suggest visiting Steel City during non-peak hours."
210,12/14/2013,Lori J.,homewood,5,Really nice pops!  The creamy ones are really creamy but not oily - a huge plus. Coffee is exceptional. Fruit flavors are really nice and bright. My most recent fav is cherry sour apple. I really liked that there was bits of real cherry throughout the pop. This is not a dull fruit flavored ice!  It's the real deal.
211,10/30/2013,Amber G.,homewood,5,"I really like this location much better than the Summit. It's the perfect setting and buttermilk continues to be my favorite flavor. I've heard it's pricey, but the pops are worth every penny! It's a good place to treat yourself. You don't have to be a kid to love these pops. They are yummy instead of sticky, overly gumball sweet that you may recall from childhood. I wish we'd had pops like these when we were kids!"
212,7/29/2013,Bryan Z.,homewood,3,Well you'd think they are selling some magic potion here.  The popsicles are pretty good but this is a lot of hype for some popsicles.  Definitely worth a stop once a month.
213,4/1/2013,Brittani V.,homewood,5,"I love thee, Steel City Pops. Eating their banana popsicle is like making out with a unicorn...it's just awesome. They have some really unusual seasonal flavors (I.e. creamed corn in the summer) but they are always delish. Don't be afraid if you see a crazy long line at their cart or store front. The line moves super fast. Not only do they make a great product, but they are extremely efficient in moving customers through the line."
214,10/21/2012,Elliott W.,homewood,5,3 word Maple.Bacon.bourbon. Perfection on a stick.
215,8/24/2013,Jacklyn H.,homewood,5,Great local favorite spot!  I love the lemon cream but sometimes get the awesome blood orange or chocolate.  So great!
216,5/25/2013,Jason C.,homewood,5,"Enjoyed Steel City Pops a couple times in the past with a chocolate-chili pepper and peanut butter pops. Tonight I filmed a quick review for my vlog of the buttermilk pop. OMG it was amazing, it totally blew my expectations of a buttermilk flavor. I only think of an old lady that was a PE teacher in elementary school that drank the gross stuff everyday. However, this was FANTASTIC! It tasted like pure cheesecake with a tangy zip! Excellent, so creamy and delicious. Would highly recommend it to you! Look for my video review at bevnerd.com soon! Thanks to them for having us."
217,3/5/2013,Jessica M.,homewood,5,"I've really come to love Steel City Pops. Since it opened, we've been quite a few times. I really hate to think about how much money we've spent on pops since last May, but that's because SCP is really just that worth it. My husband isn't a big dessert person, but he loves the strawberry balsamic pop. It works out because he's able to get something he really likes, while I stick with the creamy pops and it makes for a great dessert that is the perfect amount. Also, the staff is fantastic! Jim and Amy Watkins (owners) are generous, friendly, and definitely visionaries. We love them and their family and we're happy that they decided to put their business so close to where we live :)"
218,6/7/2013,Brian C.,homewood,4,Great pops.  The only thing that would make it better would be some sugar free offerings for the diabetics in our family.
219,3/11/2013,Michael N.,homewood,5,In a world of yogurt shops and cupcake stores these guys dare to be different. They make the Popsicles in house from all fresh ingredients. I have tried the majority of their cream based pops such as orange cream and love them. They also have fruit based pops such as the Strawberry Hibiscus
220,7/29/2012,Mike F.,homewood,5,"Delicious popsicles! This is a very simple, sweet concept.  I enjoy the cream varieties more than the iced fruit, but they are still pretty good. These are wholesome treats as opposed to the garbage you can buy at any grocery store.  The company needs more locations mostly because I don't like wading through tweens, preps, and geriatrics to get my popsicles.  How about a Southside location?"
221,7/11/2012,Jen W.,homewood,4,"First up, these popsicles are $2.75.  So don't worry, this is no $10 popsicle even though you can get a pack of 4 for $10.  If you are cruising down the main street of Homewood looking for Steel City Pops, make sure you go a street down and you will see Steel City Pops next to the Little Donkey Tacqueria.These popsicles are super refreshing.  I would definitely recommend a creamy flavor.  They are a tiny bit dryer than say a normal fudgesicle but still melt like crazy when you take it outside.  And believe me, if they say jalapeno or chili, they have not powder but true pieces of that pepper in there - SPICY!"
222,6/5/2013,Corey P.,homewood,5,"We got some popsicles while I was visiting B'ham about a month ago. The avocado popsicle was amazing. Still talking about it and craving it. I'm going back home this weekend, and I know for sure I will be getting another avocado popsicle from Steel City Pops."
223,3/12/2013,Jenn G.,homewood,5,"These popsicles are brrrilliant!  The all-natural ingredients make each flavor that much more delicious, and totally worth the price in my book. I'm excited to try more flavors, especially knowing that I don't have that guilty feeling afterward."
224,3/22/2013,Meg J.,homewood,4,Yummy! These are good pops! Wish they dipped them in chocolate all year round!
225,5/19/2013,Charles K.,homewood,4,"Delicious popsicles, but a little over-priced. I had the chocolate. Great place to go after eating at Little Donkey next door."
226,9/6/2012,Susan B.,homewood,5,Best place to hang out with friends and family and wonderful Popsicle treats
227,5/4/2013,Jered J.,homewood,5,Traveled from Prattville just to try out SteelCityPops. I'd have to say well worth it. I'm going to be battling my desire to eat an actual Hibiscus flower now because the Hibiscus pop was so incredible!
228,6/13/2014,Laura D.,homewood,5,"Wow. Fresh, delicious and made with obvious care.  Caramel was creamy and just sweet enough.  Coffee was a wonderfully strong hit of cream and espresso.  Cantelope was full of pulpy goodness.  Watermelon was absolutely refreshing.  Buttermilk was  cheesecake-like, with a great tart finish.  Can't wait to return so we can try even more flavors.  Come to Atlanta!"
229,5/21/2014,B. H.,homewood,5,"I absolutely love Steel City Pops. This is a great refreshing treat and the perfect way to end a date night, or a great way to beat the heat (though equally good in the winter as well), with flavors for both kids and adults and those with adventurous pallets or looking for a more traditional flavor. I haven't had a pop I don't like, though I personally prefer any of the cream flavored ones. I have to try a different one every time I go and always look forward to their additions to the menu and am never left disappointed."
230,5/7/2014,Sophie T.,homewood,5,"Cute place. Very kid friendly but not exclusively for kids. Makes me feel like a kid. I love it! Very nice service. Smiley, helpful people. I had the Mexican hot chocolate pop and it was real good. Also had the Hawaiian one.. Hibiscus, I think? Also very good."

Updated review",G H.,homewood,3,Pops are great but they need MORE counter help.  It is ridiculous to have 5 or 6 people running around and only one taking orders.
232,2/19/2014,Allison W.,homewood,2,"I know everyone loves this place, but I just don't think the popsicles are all that great. I love the concept, the location, and the service. However, of the 10 popsicles I've tried so far, only the buttermilk was any good. I've tried several that had almost no flavor. My creamy orange pop was completely tasteless, even less than a regular grocery store popsicle. Also, the texture of several pops was hard to get past (e.g. seeds, grainy, lumpy, falling apart). Maybe grinding up and straining out large particles would be helpful.  So overall, I haven't been impressed with the product, but I still love being able to stop by and have popsicles with friends."
233,10/25/2013,Natasha S.,homewood,3,"Great concept and good flavors. I wouldn't rate it as the best dessert/pops I've had, but its still pretty good to go back."
234,10/1/2017,Lisa H.,decatur,5,"Squeal, SCP is here!I lived in Birmingham when Steel City Pops was starting out in 2012, as a single store in Homewood, Alabama, so their pops are near and dear to me (sorry, King of Pops). Now, after really taking off, they boast around 20 pop shops in Alabama, Texas, Kentucky, and now Georgia.The downtown Decatur SCP officially opened 9/30/2017. This is the largest location I've been in. The space is very clean and modern, with plenty of seating at communal tables and counters, as well as on benches outside. The working kitchen is enclosed in glass and adds a zoo-like slant to the whole experience. The ladies at the register and the guy who seemed to be a manager were super enthusiastic and seemed really glad to have us there.Pops come in fruity, creamy, and cookie (a baked good is frozen into the pop) varieties. As you'd expect, all the ingredients are natural/organic and locally sourced if possible. The fruity and creamy pops are $3.49. You can all get your pop enhanced with sauces, toppings, and spices if you're into that, for an extra charge of course.This particular visit, I was in a creamy mood and ordered the carrot cake which was tastylicious, especially with the heavy cream cheese slant. Little pecan bits at the stick end added to the whole experience. My companion got the cranberry orange which was sweet, tart, and Thanksgiving-esque. Fantastic. Not sure I'm crazy about the calorie counts being printed on the menus. Can't we just pretend they are all 0 calories?Flavors change seasonally, but some some choices I recommend include avocado, buttermilk, caramel, blackberry, mango, passionfruit, and strawberry balsamic.There's a phone number-based loyalty program. But 10, get 1 free. And if you have a punchcard, they'll happily transfer your punches to the new star system.Two unisex bathrooms are available.Parking in downtown Decatur is getting to be more and more obnoxious. The lot in front of the store is pay only, with no SCP-designated slots or anything. I know Atlanta is a King of Pops town, but I hope Steel City Pops can coexist and thrive as well. I for one, am thrilled they've arrived. Welcome, SCP!"
235,9/29/2017,Nishant G.,decatur,5,"A different take on popsicles! Real ice cream, fresh ingredients, exceptional service, great atmosphere! The popsicles have actual ingredients (peanut butter, oatmeal, etc), not cheap flavoring. Really impressed! A great place for dessert after dinner in the area! 5 stars!"
236,10/1/2017,Lindsey D.,decatur,5,"I've had the privilege of visiting Steel City in B'ham and at the Shops Buckhead while waiting for this location to open. The GM is a breeze to work with for catering events. The team in store is delightful and will easily guide you toward an awesome choice. Buttermilk is my standby fave, but definitely try the Toasted Marshmallow dipped in chocolate and dusted with graham cracker crumbs. So glad SCP is in ATL!"
237,9/29/2017,Uma P.,decatur,5,"You guys! It's new! Soft opening. Super friendly service, fast and efficient. Very unique with great variety. Come check it out. Great addition to the ATL scene. Great location too, lots of bars and restaurants nearby. You can make you own pop, flavor, dipping sauce etc. not 100% sure about prices bc today it was free (bonus points) but I doubt its expensive. COME CHECK IT OUT!"
238,9/2/2017,Gary P.,louisville-3,5,"First visit, and this place was fun.  You start with one of many different house made popsicles, then have them dipped, sprinkled, and sauced with your choice from a wide variety of toppings.  Clearly a popular spot, I saw adults, teens, and kids all enjoying designing and watching their treats made.  Or you can just order some of the house designed creations if you dont want to design your own treat.Either way, a great treat, especially in a warm night."
239,8/20/2017,Samantha D.,louisville-3,5,"Yes.Yes.Yes! I had heard of Steel City Pops from fellow yelpers so I was very excited to come here. They did not disappoint!The location is convenient and they have outdoor seating which is a plus in the summer when you want to enjoy one of these pops!The menu is quite impressive and I must say I had a hard time choosing a flavor. I decided to go with passion fruit and WOW! It was incredibly delicious! They had strawberry lemonade, iced tea, root beer, ginger ale, avocado, pineapple jalapeño as well as others. You can also ""make-your-own"" if you prefer.Each pop is about $3 so they are quite pricey but in my opinion, definitely worth it!"
240,8/16/2017,Mike K.,louisville-3,5,A great alternative for dessert or just a treat.We have often visited SCP after eating dinner on Bardstown Road.They have a great variety of flavors all for $3. My favorite is Chocolate Chili. I enjoy trying them all.We now buy them by the case as they pack them and label them in a cool carry case. At night they are a great alternative to ice cream as they start at ~100 calories.Service is always fast so don't get discouraged if there is a line.Go around the sides of the counter and u can often catch them making the pops.
241,8/7/2017,Liza X.,louisville-3,3,"3.5 starsSwung by Steel City Pops before they closed and after the line had died down. We were looking for something refreshing in the humidity. I know the whole fancy popsicle thing has been spreading across Instagram but I always thought it wasn't worth the price... not sure my mind has been changed. Maybe I should have gone with something fruity but I got the peanut butter pie pop dipped in chocolate w/ chopped walnuts. The pop was certainly photogenic and the interior of the shop was perfect for taking photos of these pops. However, I wasn't wowed by the flavors. It was definitely much more natural tasting but the flavors weren't strong enough or distinct enough and it was a littler less creamy than I would have liked. I understand if a fruit flavor is a little icy, but the peanut butter pie is actually vanilla ice cream based so I would have expected a more similar texture. Additionally, the texture of the hard chocolate dipping around the pop somehow didn't work for me - perhaps a drizzle would have been better? Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but I didn't feel the desire to come back for more... expect for a picture."
242,7/23/2017,Allison F.,louisville-3,4,"On a scale of 1 to Nicey Treat in Indianapolis, Steel City Pops gets a solid 8.  At $3/popsicle, the fruity and creamy flavors are on-point, and the options to ""dip, dredge, and drizzle"" on your pops makes customizing easy.  I ordered the cookies & cream, and I found it to be a good choice.Why not a 10?  Having another popsicle company to compare it to back home, I think the flavor was a tad more subtle than I would have liked it to be.  Still, it doesn't change the fact that I could have ordered a second one.  Next time, I'll try a fruity flavor."
243,7/10/2017,Kimber G.,louisville-3,5,"FINALLY went to Steel City Pop's the other week after dreaming about their icy delights on a stick since they opened in Louisville. I took advantage of a sunny day to 'pop' in during my lunch break and never have I had a more refreshing lunch. Parked almost directly in front of the storefront and walked in, no waiting. 12:15 pm on a Thursday is a good time to go, future reference. I love that the calories in each popsicle are posted, it made me choose a healthier option. I went with the Lavender Lemonade (93ish cal) while my friend got the Strawberry Lemonade. Affordable and nicely pre-packaged, we had paid and were sitting  outside on the benches facing Bardstown Rd in under 4 minutes. Mine was a hit. Nicely tart with a hint of lavender aftertaste, I was a true fan. I took a nibble of my friend's and was amazed at how fresh the strawberry taste was. It seemed like there were literal pieces of strawberry in there! Yum, but I liked mine better. The tartness, mmmm. Yass. Spent a relaxing 13 minutes devouring our frozen treats before I sadly had to return to work. I'm definitely coming back to try other flavors! The naughty side of me says try the coffee or chooclate ones, but the healthy side of me says don't, that's too many calories for a popsicle! Maybe I'll splurge for a cheat meal...hmm. Nonetheless, an awesome treat at an affordable price!"
244,7/4/2017,Jessica T.,louisville-3,5,"This is a fantastic place for dessert especially if you are strolling down Bardstown road.  There is often a line, but the staff are kind and work fast.   They have lots of fun popsicle flavors. Some fruity, some creamy, always fun, and you can add toppings if you'd like.  My favorite is white tea champagne, but I also like rootbeer and pineapple jalapeño a lot!  They have a rewards program so you can earn a free pop without having to carry around a punch card.  I have been here many times and I always have a good experience.  Go for a stroll and enjoy the sun while you have a pop!"
245,6/29/2017,Leigh V.,louisville-3,5,"I finally tried this place out. I'm a sucker for ice cream but not so much popsicles. However, I kept an open-mind in honor of the first date night in 5 months time.I went with a chocolate flavor so it was like I was having my beloved mint chocolate chip ice cream on a stick. My decision was resting on the chocolate chip brownie pop but do I drizzle or did? I had that thing dipped in white chocolate. Holy moly. It was divine. The one thing I noticed is I could bite right into it without having a moment of sensitivity with my teeth. Plus, this pop didn't melt while I ate it. The service was fast and friendly considering there was a line out the door. I cannot wait to try the lemonade lavender. I also recommend having them at any summer wedding because that is not basic but *orginial*."
246,4/29/2017,Jessica R.,louisville-3,5,"Amazing!!!I simply love this place. Straight from the get go the outside of the shop is so aesthetically pleasing. It is a beautiful mix of warm stained wood and the sharp silver of the steel. Very trendy and cute. I have to this shop a few times and every time I go there is always a line out the door and a crowd of people outside sitting and enjoying their pops creating a rainbow of colors. The staff are always very warm and welcoming. It is clearly their goal to make sure that you have a great experience at their store, not just simply buy a popsicle. Everytime I have come in, they always ask if it is my first time in or if I would like them to review any of the flavors. Everytime I have been in with someone new, the sales associate goes over the history of the shop and the flavors that are available. The menu is spilt, with fruity flavors on the left and the creamy dairy based flavors on the right. I personally prefer the creamy pops, which and really more icecream in popsicle form. I really like the cookie one, and peanut butter. As far as fruity, I've only tried the stawberry balsamic, which was good. A little too out there for me. This trip, I got the chai latte, which was incredible and just the right blend of sweet and spicy. There is a bar with stools inside against the window facing out towards Bardstown rd, where I sat and people watched and enjoyed my pop. Great experience, and anytime you're on Bardstown it's worth a stop!"
247,3/6/2017,Shelby Z.,louisville-3,5,"Steel City Pops....I'm so glad that we finally met!! I have been wanting to go here so bad ever since it opened.. After its grand opening, it didn't take long for me to see people constantly checking in here and posting photos of their delicious-looking pops.    SCP has always been one of those places my friends and I say ""We should go there sometime!"" every time we drive by, but it would just never happen. So finally when we were looking to kill time one day, I made the suggestion and we headed right on over.    It seems like this place gets pretty crowded on the weekends and over the summer, with the line going out the door. We came on a chilly Friday afternoon and it was nearly dead. The atmosphere and inside is so clean and modern, I love it! With the menu on top of the wall, it was so difficult to decide what I wanted - it all sounded so good! I ended up getting a Root Beer Float pop with dark chocolate drizzle ( which by the way, you can get your pops dipped, drizzled, or dusted in white, milk, or dark chocolate....pretty cool!   The pop was wonderful, with a gourmet taste. Definitely a great addition to Louisville, I'm also excited to see them branching out to St. Matthews soon!"
248,8/28/2017,Eric M.,louisville-3,5,"Pretty awesome place, the flavors they have for the pops are awesome. My favorite by far is the pineapple jalapeño. The cucumber lime is also very good. If you have a hankering for a refreshing treat check it out!"

Updated review",Cortney K.,louisville-3,5,"I've been eying this spot for weeks and finally stopped by yesterday as the weather was hot and sticky. I tried the strawberry cream - this is my first one from SCPs and already my favorite. It's fresh and creamy, no way one couldn't love it with all the chucks of real strawberries in it. I LOVE that they post the calories of each one (strawberry cream was less than 200). They are quick behind the counter so don't be discourage when there's a long line. It'll only be a few minutes of waiting.Now I have to try them all!!"
250,6/23/2017,Scott B.,louisville-3,5,"""Go all the way to the Highlands...for popsicles?""-HELL YES!""A $3 POPSICLE?""-Uh, I'd pay twice that. Well, probably not but you get the point.""It's just popsicles.""-Exactly. Except popsicles from heaven.Totally deserving of every bit of hype. Trendy? Yes. Overrun by curiosity seekers and first-timers who will get in your way of popsicle-induced bliss? Usually. Wonder how they stay open in the winter? I do. Nevertheless, get your sweet azz over the Steel City Pops ASAP and start lickin'."
251,12/31/2016,Fox E.,louisville-3,5,"My dad is from Pittsburgh. So I call him Steel City Pops. He founded this chain.My cats love this too. I mean look at Starlight.This was my first experience of my Dad's chain. I was surprised at how damn good it is. It's such a trendy hipstery type store, I expected Hibiscus Garlic Aioli Lollies (we call them ice lollies in England, you call them popsicles). But no, their top seller is Strawberry Lemonade, and it's amaaaaaaaaaaazing.Sure they're a little overpriced, but I can see exactly why this chain has popped up all over the country and is doing as well as it is. They taste damn good. I'm not a fan of chains, but it's not like there are a ton of local places selling incredible homemade popsicles. It's an untapped and forgotten market with a lot of bad products, and this chain has popped up (no pun intended) and made popsicles a thing again, with a very high quality product.The girl who served me was super sweet, too. And the all-female customers were making fun of me and my English accent. Which I appreciated.So I absolutely loved it, and the 5 stars is well deserved.And even if a lot of people don't give it 5 stars, I will Steel stand by my rating."
252,9/3/2017,Lori D.,louisville-3,5,This is by far the best place we stopped for desserts.   The pops are a little expensive at $3.50 each but they are really good.  I had the peaces and cream and my kids had strawberry and cream.  They will let you trade your pop in for a different one if you really don't like the flavor. Very nice staff.  We came here twice while visiting Louisville.   I wish we had one of these in our areas.
253,1/25/2017,Sydney B.,louisville-3,5,"I was bored one day so I told my mom that me and her are going to have a bonding night since it does not happen often. We had dinner but did not want to go home yet so we went here because we wanted to try it out. This place is weird (in a good way). I have never heard of a place that sells popsicles and the town rave about it. When we got to the building it was busy; I mean out the door busy. When we got to the counter we realized this was not your typical shop. There were flavors that I never heard of. The one i got was either strawberry or raspberry, I can't remember exactly which one I got. There are fantastic and reasonably priced. I recommend this place for anyone that needs something to cool off on a summer day."
254,5/17/2017,Lauren H.,louisville-3,5,"SO THANKFUL the Steel City Pops cart is posted up outside Humana all summer. This pregnant lady will be a customer every single day. Not an exaggeration.As most know, Steel City Pops has an actual store in the Highlands serving amazing, unique, and creative popsicles of both the fruity and creamy variety. I've tried many flavors of each and have yet to find one that I didn't like. The creamy popsicles are my personal fav because they're literally ice cream on a stick. In addition to the storefront, SCP also has a mobile cart that I've seen at various events, festivals, or hotspots around town, like the mall or, say, the Humana building during lunch hours. This makes me so happy as I love the popsicles but rarely make it to their store. The cart has limited choices (and they're usually the safer options), but they do switch them up every so often."
255,6/22/2017,Vi P.,louisville-3,5,"YUM! I stopped by here at night to get some dessert with my cousins and mom! I must say it was a good choice! This place was definitely a hot spot when we arrived. They have so many unique flavors to choose from it was so difficult! The popsicles tasted delicious! They were fresh tasting, not too creamy, or too sweet! I would say they have the perfect popsicles! Great way to cool down and have a light dessert or snack! Below are some of the flavors I remembered trying! They were all great! Flavors: 1. Sweet tea 2. Coconut 3. Chocolate with chocolate drizzle! 4. Cookies & cream 5. Blood orange 6. ElderflowerMake sure to check @livingphamtastic on Instagram for more food and travel pictures! :)"
256,7/28/2017,Heather B.,louisville-3,5,Steel City Pops was delicious! I got the blueberry basil and thoroughly enjoyed it. My husband loved strawberry cream one and said it was delicious. Highly recommended! I'm excited to go back and try more flavors.
257,8/23/2017,Casey B.,louisville-3,4,"I'm a fan.  I realize that quality popsicles have been a trendy thing for more than a while.  Steel City pops does really one thing really well -- high quality popsicles.  I tend to patronage local businesses first and so typically a chain like Steel City would be one I'd consider ignoring.  But this is more a preference than a hard rule, and so I tried it for the first time a while back.  So yeah it can be hard to pick a flavor out of the many that the store has, but they have been excellent."
258,6/3/2017,Lorie L.,louisville-3,5,"I made a special trip to Steel City Pops as part of the family's summer bucket list. We've tried them at art fairs but I knew more flavors awaited us.Each pop is $3, or 4 for $11. Totally worth it. People look at me funny, like ""you paid that much for a popsicle?"" but they're missing the point. They're fruity, or creamy, and last as long as any ice cream cone.Highly recommended by my family: chocolate  (simple can be delish), vanilla bean, strawberry lemonade (tart), lime (refreshing), blood orange (like a tangerine) and chai latte (just like Starbucks).If you stop by the store, you'll find 15-20 flavors. Some are staples, others are seasonal. There's options to dip, drizzle or dredge them with toppings. You can catch a few chairs in the windows or benches outside. Enjoy!"
259,8/11/2017,Diane C.,louisville-3,4,I had a vanilla bean ice cream with salty caramel drizzle and cayenne pepper. It was so delicious. It tasted so natrual and fresh. It was a great little treat followed up with a walk on Bardstown Rd. Fun night!!!
260,11/6/2016,Vien L.,louisville-3,5,"Great service and tasty gourmet ice pops with some delicious flavors! The only real downer is the price. I gotta give them five stars although the price really makes me want to knock it down to four. But the pops value is what people are willing to pay for it... people go in and leave happy as did I!The place is nicely lit and there is a good amount of space which does fill up quickly at times with so many people looking for a nice dessert. So you go in, pick your pop and then you can opt to have it topped with a drizzle of caramel for example. Depending on who is doing the topping and If they are busy or not, the pops can come out looking beautiful and tasty. I can't recommend a flavor because you probably have a favorite ice cream flavor ingrained in your being since you were two years old so go in and give it a try! They are pretty cool in here and if you don't like your flavor after bite #1, you can politely ask them to exchange it for a new flavor! Just don't be THAT person who ruins it for everyone by being a jerk about it by trying to sample 10 flavors! If you're that person, you're not clever, you're not a criminal mastermind, you're not George Clooney in Oceans Eleven... you're just an immature, petty, cheap human being. Also this place is a dope poke stop and there is a gym as well! It's pretty fun chilling here and people watching. There are definitely fun people in Louisville! The workers here have always been super sweet, so be nice to them."
261,4/18/2017,Kaylee H.,louisville-3,5,"I had the cantaloupe pop, which was amazing. It was rich and just the perfect amount of sweetness to be refreshing but not heavy. It was true to flavor, which I was impressed by. I also tasted the elderflower flavor, which was on point but very light. They don't have samples, but you are able to trade in your pop flavor for another one if you try it and don't like it."
262,7/30/2017,Chris H.,louisville-3,4,"Moving here from Ohio, I was addicted to streetpops in Cinci. Had to try Steel City and was not let down. The place is very clean. The staff is super helpful, even at their busiest. I had the Pineapple Jalapeno pop, which, I will admit, had zero jalapeno in it, but did have red pepper flakes scattered throughout. These suckers are huge, so well worth the price tag. I've also tried the cookies and cream pop, which was also phenomenal. Will definitely be heading there again."
263,8/12/2016,Kristen B.,louisville-3,5,"I'll be the first to admit that I didn't want to see Wild & Wooly close and turn into a ...Popsicle shop? I figured it'd open and close and we'd see Todd teaching Pilates back in his old space in the span of a few months.And, preferring to eat local, a shop from Alabama? All this is relevant, as I absolutely think the pops are tops and I feel they could even use a 2nd location!I've tried both sides of the menu--they have ""fruity"" or ""creamy"". Blueberry cream was so fresh that I ended up getting seeds stuck in my teeth. The Strawberry Lemonade was very refreshing. I like that calorie counts are posted, too, so if you are watching your diet, you can make a pretty healthy choice.It's a great spot to grab a pop and walk around a fun section of the Highlands. Don't be scared of the long lines--they move people through quickly. Now, these are not the $ store variety, most are around $4 each, but if you want a great dessert, snack or even treat on the go, don't hesitate!"
264,8/14/2016,Stephanie B.,louisville-3,5,"I was still grieving over the loss of Wild and Wooly Video Store when Steel City Pops opened in its place on Bardstown Road. I wanted to hate this place. I WANTED TO HATE IT SO MUCH. Over time, my coworker managed to talk me into giving it a try. This has now become our preferred 2:30 pick me up from the office blues. Each popsicle is a flat price of$3.00- and there are so many unique flavors! Guava, avocado, and pineapple jalapeno are just a few of the offerings."
265,7/31/2016,Megan M.,louisville-3,5,"You guys....these are hands down the best popsicles you're going to eat! Whether you have the fruit based or milk based bars you can't go wrong! Large portions, creamy pops, great price and crazy fast service. Like others have said it's a small location but the line moves fast and on any given day there will be a line.On this first visit I bought a 4 pop pack which they pack in a lined brown bag and put 1 or 2 ice packs in for travel. I purchased the horchata, peanut butter chocolate banana, guava and peaches and cream. If you've never been make sure you tell them so you can receive and punch card. 10 pop or 4 pop bag purchases and you receive a free pop or bag. I couldn't wait to get home and try these flavors. Once home, I immediately went for the horchata first and it did not disappoint!! Rich creamy cinnamon flavor with a graham cracker layer on the bottom! I know they rotate flavors frequently but I hope this one is a frequent flyer because I love this flavor profile and horchata is so hard to come by. My husband had the PBC bar and loved it. I had one bite, and while that combo is delicious its really easy to have the banana overpower all other flavors. But this bar had a nice balance and once again was creamy and not icy.The other two bars are in the freezer and I can't wait to try them out later this week!! I'll definitely be returning and trying all the other unique flavors....can't wait til fall and pumpkin comes on the menu!!"
266,8/29/2016,Stephanie S.,louisville-3,5,"I am a huge fan, and I cannot wait to go again!EVERY. SINGLE. ITEM. is Gluten-Free! Plus, there are several vegan and vegetarian items as well! HUGE WIN! The Popsicle flavors are endless, and many of the flavor combinations"
267,6/13/2017,Jackie L.,louisville-3,5,Steel City pops is a wonderful treat for the whole family.  Their pop-slick are mind blowing! I have never had a pop-slick bursting with so many different flavors. The price is reasonable and customer service is great. I am giving Steel City Pops  5 stars.
268,9/4/2017,Erin R.,louisville-3,5,"We took our kids to try this place.  Very pleased and so much fun.  We each got different kinds: lime, strawberry cream, peanut butter, vanilla bean dipped in chocolate with toasted coconut.  All were amazing!!!  We will definitely return when passing through Louisville!  Not too far off of 65."
269,1/17/2017,Eliah T.,louisville-3,5,"The prices are great! The pops are phenomenal! The space is super clean, being sleek & warm at the same time. My favorite part was the glass windows giving you a 100% view of kitchen. Love it!!We decided on two: Root beer float: omg!!! Tastes like the very best float you've ever had in your life....on a stick!!And one I can't remember the name, but tasted like a cream soda with chunks. It was wonderful.We will go back often. We will take all of our friends. We will buy boxes of many flavors to take home. Great concept. Executed brilliantly with a yummy product."
270,7/1/2017,Paige R.,louisville-3,5,"""STEEL. CITY. POPS.Where to begin.  Steel city pops is no ordinary pop shop.  Upon opening the front door, the sweet chill hits your finger tips and sends a glorious shiver up your spine.  The exposed brick and cold metal exudes sweet creamy happiness.  The first pop that ever came across my lips was buttermilk. To be honest, I was a bit cautious.  A buttermilk pop? ""Ew"", I thought.  But my sister insisted.. so I gave in. ""I'll take the buttermilk?"" I asked hesitantly.  The girl snipped the clear little wrapper and handed me what I thought would be a less than mediocre flavored pop, but boy was I wrong.  The cheesecake like creaminess hit all my senses.  Rainbows shot out of my eyes. Shooting stars erupted from my ears.  My face became blemish free.  It was like Beethoven himself was playing music with every lick I took.  As a tear fell down my rosy happy cheek, I knew.  Life itself would never be the same.  Since this day, I have become steel city's #1 fan.  I check their Snapchat daily.  I own a t shirt.  I ONLY purchase 4 pop bags, because who could every only choose one?! With the ever changing flavors, one will never become bored.  BUT. Do not fear. Buttermilk is ALWAYS on the menu.  My only sadness, is that I live in Florida. So I am sure to visit louisville often, JUST for STEEL CITY POPS.  I love you, Steel City Pops.""- Hannah""P.S. please come to Jacksonville, FL"""
271,9/4/2017,Missy I.,louisville-3,5,"I visited for the second time on Labor Day, with my husband and teen daughter, around 3pm. Once again, the store was clean inside and out, and the pops were delicious! We had coconut (so refreshing) and coffee flavor, dipped in chocolate (rich and flavorful!). The place was very busy, but the staff kept things running smoothly and our wait wasn't very long. Will definitely return!"
272,12/10/2016,Joseph T.,louisville-3,5,"How have I not written a review here?Frozen sugar water for cheap. It CANNOT be beaten. They have fruity popsicles and creamy ones. They're all excellent. And even if you get one that isn't tasty, there's a good likelihood that it was unique and fun.You seriously can't beat Steel City Pops on a warm day.Oh, and take your doggy. They let doggies come in and pick their favorite flavor. The fruity flavors are dog friendly!"
273,7/4/2017,Matt B.,louisville-3,5,"I've been to this Steel City Pops location a couple times now and each time I'm blown away by how good it is! I'm not a huge popsicle fan, but I make an exception for this place. I can't get off the cookie pops. I love the Cookies and Cream and most recently, I had the Peanut Butter Pie with a Dark Chocolate drizzle. Both are crazy good! The Peanut Butter Pie pop basically has a whole peanut butter cookie inside of it. The prices have gone up and it was $4.50 for the pop and an extra $1.00 for the drizzle. I'm not sure the drizzle adds $1.00 worth of value (maybe I should've dusted it with cocoa instead), but they can definitely afford to charge this much for how good the pops are and how busy they are. There are always plenty of people enjoying pops each time I go. I definitely look forward to coming back throughout the summer to try more of their refreshing pops!"
274,5/25/2016,Christopher S.,louisville-3,5,"Of all the bandwagons I hopped on I am glad I hopped on this one: Marcia V and Kathy V, thou art never wrong.  Amen. I loved it:  It was easy to figure out ordering, the product was made locally, the prices were reasonable, the service was friendly, the location was perfect.  I liked it so much I went back and got some to take home and a gift certificate for my family.  I had a pomegranate pop and my friend had lemon aide lavender.  Both were really good, in fact I tasted her pop and it was better than mine but I was by no means disappointed.  If you don't like it they'll switch you out after the first bite!  AMAZING.  I had a watermelon one at home and I promise you this: it wasn't artificial watermelon.  It was legit (too legit to quit) watermelon.  * They have seating inside, seating outside, and seating in the rear* The line moves quickly * The simplicity lent itself to efficiency and the place was very clean * They offer dairy and non dairy pop options, I only tried fruit flavors * They have a frequent flier program, praise be to Jesus BONUS ROUND! It was a specialized White People Zoo.  All kinds of white people and they're not  checking their privilege.  It was people watching the worst at it's best."
275,7/19/2016,Sandra W.,louisville-3,5,"Delicious! Even though it's $3, you'll be happy you spent it - Great dessert for a hot summah day. Life is great again when you put a Steel City Pop in your hand. Must check it out!Love the pineapple and limeade one! I don't remember the actual names. Oh the jasmine tea one was really good, too. Difficult parking, though. I'd suggest park in the neighborhoods and walk to SCP."
276,6/28/2016,Jim F.,louisville-3,5,"It was a Sunday afternoon and it was a 94° day.  After running our weekly errands I was thinking ""I could use a cold snack"".  My brain instantly went to Steel City Pops, partly because I'd heard a lot about them, and partly because it keeps coming up on Yelp, tempting me and taunting me.""Ok, Google.  Navigate me to Steel City Pops"".After about a 10 minute drive we arrived, parked in the street next to a street artist, and walked in.  The air conditioning went a long way in making it THE PLACE to be on this inferno of a Sunday afternoon.  The inside was busy, but not packed, and we were able to walk right up to the counter to make our selections.I'd read about a Jalapeño Pineapple pop in several reviews, but was sadly informed that they were seasonal and no longer available.  I was only sad for a moment, though, because they had many other flavors to choose from.  I opted for Pomegranate, my wife got Lime.  Not being people who like to stand around, we walked outside and sat down on one of the benches to enjoy our popsicles in the shade.At $3 a piece, the prices is actually very reasonable, given they're all-natural and made at the location.  They're also pretty sizable...and the popsicle stick is emblazoned with ""Steel City Pops"".  The flavors change pretty routinely, so there's always something new to try.All in all, it was well worth the drive to finally try a Steel City Pop.  Anyone who's mentioned them to me had nothing but great things to say.  I am glad to say that I am now among them."
277,8/18/2017,Cheyenne P.,louisville-3,4,"best, most expensive pops I've ever had...and yes, I'll visit again...it's THAT good!"
278,7/3/2016,Jenna J.,louisville-3,5,Damn good popsicle! Friendly atmosphere and a lot of flavor choices. I got the avocado pop and bf got the strawberry shortcake. Both were fantastic. The avocado was sweeter than expected with a lime flavor to it. Super creamy and not icy. Happy licking!!
279,5/18/2016,Kelly P.,louisville-3,5,"We've been wanting to try Steel City Pops since they opened their doors to Louisville, but we were waiting so as to avoid the large crowds that have gathered since the opening. Finally, a couple of weekends ago, we found our chance! And luckily, it was a beautifully warm spring day!The location is perfect, right off of Bardstown Road in the Highlands, so it's very convenient. The décor is nice. It's clean and simple, and it has a local flair with the mural along the back wall. B chose the Strawberry Lemonade popsicle and I opted for the Lime. Both were absolutely delicious! We'll definitely be back to try all of the other flavors!"
280,8/18/2017,Sue L.,louisville-3,5,Totally yummy! I love the fruit flavors dipped in dark chocolate! I'm so glad this place is far from where I live or I'd be there frequently!
281,4/19/2016,Kathy V.,louisville-3,5,"When I saw a new popsicle place was coming to the Highlands, my only hope was that they would be at least comparable to my beloved King of Pops...I was not disappointed!Same price, but available all the time within walking distance of where I live! There looks to be a great selection of flavors (will there be new/different/experimental flavors along the way? Because I'd like to request a chocolate sea salt flavor....I will buy all of them!). I got the sweet tea....perfectly refreshing on a hot day! My friend let me taste her hibiscus pop....also super tasty!The punch card is a great thing too...because I know I will absolutely be back and I won't mind being rewarded for my visits!"
282,4/8/2016,Emily H.,louisville-3,5,"Steel City Pops is DANGEROUS!This new store has popsicles that are handmade, as in inside the kitchen right behind the registers. You can see popsicles being made through windows, looking into the kitchen, as you eat your pops.This location is right in the middle of the busy Bardstown Road/Baxter Avenue intersection.And, I mean, popsicles! I don't think you can be unhappy and eat one of these popsicles. These pops are downright delicious -- the best I've ever had! I've tried a couple of flavors, and the coffee and toasted marshmallow popsicles are so far my favorites. Both have coffee beans and toasted bits, respectively, at the end of the popsicles, which is a neat touch. They're creamy. Just oh so good. Plus, popsicles are just so accessible. You pretty much always have time for a popsicle. They're easily transportable. An ice cream sundae? Not so much. But I can be on my way with a popsicle in just a couple of minutes. See what I mean? Dangerous! And I like how Steel City has made their pops a flat $3, which includes tax. No fumbling for change needed. Steel City also serves coffee, in case you want to enjoy a popsicle and then a coffee to warm you up on a cold day.The location is as cute as a button, and the staff has been as sweet as their popsicles.If you can't find me, I'm probably getting a popsicle at Steel City!"
283,5/2/2016,Marcia V.,louisville-3,5,"I have been wanting to go here for FOREVER (if forever means since it opened)! I was finally able to get here on a sunny and warm part of a Sunday, before the rain started. After staring at the menu, and deciding I wanted everything, I made a decision on the Blood Orange. Nothing to strange, but still different than things I have get at a store or anywhere else and I was super happy with my choice! It was fruity and refreshing! Next time I am in, I will have to pull myself away from this delicious flavor, and try something else delicious on their menu!"
284,4/15/2016,Elissa B.,louisville-3,4,"It was a chill afternoon, and my fiance and I found ourselves at the Flea off Market. I don't know what made me gravitate toward their Popsicle stand, maybe it was nostalgia, maybe it was curiosity, or maybe I just knew their was a delicious treat in their waiting for me Holy Grail style. They had creamy selections and fruity selections (blood orange, mango and strawberry lemonade) and Creamy selections (buttermilk, chocolate, and toasted marshmallow), a smaller selection than what is seen in the store location it seems. But something about a Popsicle sounded delicious and refreshing. After some debating I went with what seemed obvious, in choosing the mango pop. A creamy Popsicle sounds interesting, but at the time wasn't really my jam. I was pleased with the flavor and the consistency of the Popsicle. it was fruity and sweet and all things an indulgence should consist of. It almost tasted like fresh, frozen mango, I really have no complaints (Minus when I accidentally dropped the last bite on the ground. I'm mad at myself). I know their store front location replaced the old Wild & Woolly, so Id be interested to check it out. I will check it out, and can't wait."
285,6/4/2017,Kristin L.,louisville-3,5,"Delicious!! Stopped at Falafal House for lunch, and when leaving noticed SteelCityPops. Decided to give it a go. While waiting for it to open, groups of people started waiting outside. Luckily one of the girls waiting worked there (it was her day off) so glwe fot to ask different question. They had great flacor combos, all bread topping options are gluten free. You can dip or drizzle chocolate, white, chocolate, dark...add different toppings, toasted coconut, graham cracker, nuts, sprinkles, etc. They had fruit & cream pops. I had the buttermilk drizzled in milk chocolate, sprinkled in graham crackers. It was delish."
286,5/5/2016,Sarah L.,louisville-3,5,What can I say? THIS PLACE IS FREAKING AMAZING. I was very skeptical of taking part in such a popular cultural attraction but I am so so glad I did. My best friend heard they had organic chai latte pops and said we had to go there. They were absolutely to die for. For $3 I am convinced these will be a cheap solution to a hot day. The line was not to bad and I love the clean cut and modern style of the little business. The chai pops were amazing and had the cinnamon dusted on top and they were so milky and creamy which is not something you usually associate with a popsicle. This will be my summer go to place.
287,4/26/2016,Don B.,louisville-3,5,"I heard a lot of hype about this place and I was skeptical. This place lives up to the hype and may even surpass it.The menu is simple. Somewhere around 16 types of Popsicles under two categories, fruity or creamy. The choices range from mango to sweet tea on the fruit side and simple flavors like chocolate to out there flavors like Chai tea. Having tried mango, peanut butter, and chai tea now, I'm impressed. Every Popsicle at Steel City is packed with flavor. My only thought for comparison was the 100 pack of Popsicles my dad used to buy at the beginning of each summer. I expected a watery, boring flavor from these Popsicles. Each of the flavors is bold and fantastic. The inside of Steel City Pops is simple. The counter is the main event and two hallways on the side of the counter lead to a few seats and a restroom. This place is all about functionality. There are a few seats outside, but the Popsicles are quite portable. They come on plastic wrap that is cut open for you so you have something to hold the Popsicle in. The staff was very polite and helped me decide on the chai tea Popsicle. I will definitely come back to this place."
288,8/10/2017,Tammy R.,louisville-3,5,I got the coffee dipped in dark chocolate and Treana got the peanut butter pie dipped in dark chocolate
289,8/1/2017,Frankie S.,louisville-3,5,"Yummy Stuff!  While it's hot outside - go get ya sum!  Okay, you can go there when it's cold too!  It'll still by Yummy!"
290,4/20/2016,Brian B.,louisville-3,4,"I was a little skeptical about this place. A fancy popsicle stand? Well, I shouldn't have been, because it's cool (literally and figuratively).Apparently it's a big hit right now in the Highlands, because every time I walk or drive past it in the evening, there are people spilling out all over the sidewalks licking their popsicles. It was crowded when we went on a warm Tuesday night. We stood in line for a couple of minutes, then ordered our frozen treats, which are made in house. I got a strawberry pop, while my wife got the marshmallow one. They were $3 each, which is a little pricey for a popsicle, but they were fairly large.How did it taste? Well, mine tasted exactly like a strawberry popsicle should. My wife's was a little more flavorful (but also had more calories). There is not much seating inside here, so most people find a spot on the street or curb. The good thing about popsicles, though, is that they're pretty mobile.All in all, this is an interesting concept for the warm spring and summer months. I have no idea how they will continue to stay open during the winter (hot popsicles?) and I'm not sure how many times I will crave a $3 popsicle even when it's sweltering. But it's a fun place to stop when you're walking through the Highlands."
291,4/15/2017,Angela K.,louisville-3,5,Just go here.  You will get back in line to get more popsicles while you are eating popsicles.  I would go out of my way to pass through Louisville to stop here.Every single one is delicious.
292,4/30/2017,Samantha R.,louisville-3,5,"I never thought I would enjoy a popsicle as much as I do when I'm in Steel City Pops. Forget about the old freezer popsicles from your youth, these pops are artisanal and unbelievable. SCP is located between Mellow Mushroom and Wicks at Bardstown and Baxter. On a warm day, the line is usually out the door. Steel City Pops is very open and industrial. When you enter you can pick pops from the right or left side of the counter. One side is for fruity flavors and the other side is for creamy flavors. The staff is always helpful and will go over new flavors for you. The creamy pops taste like ice cream on a stick. I've tried too many flavors to list but I loved the chai tea, toasted marshmallow, and avocado. Yes, avocado. SCP specializes in ""odd"" flavors. The best part is that they want you to be adventurous. If you try one that you do not like just tell them and they will let you pick another one.There are stools along the front of the store but also stools along the sides of the shop that peer into the kitchen. If you're lucky, you'll be able to watch as they make new pops. The pops are three dollars flat. If you're looking for a delicious dessert or treat check out Steel City Pops!"
293,4/1/2017,Raymond R.,louisville-3,5,The popsicles are incredible. I got the coffee one dipped in dark chocolate and it was the best popsicle I have had. I think the prices are fair and the employees are very nice and friendly. I'd highly recommend it.
294,9/18/2016,Holly H.,louisville-3,5,"So cool and so good! I've had the pleasure of enjoying Steel City Pops at a few outdoor events, and today I finally made it to their brick and mortar. Everything I have had has been wonderful! Cookies and cream, coffee, strawberry lemonade...all have been super good. If you need a treat, go. You will not be disappointed. I didn't sit so I won't comment on the chairs. Lol"
295,4/26/2017,Jan E.,louisville-3,5,Frozen fruit & ice cream pops par excellence. I had creamy coffee dipped in chocolate.  Eyes rolling back into head.  Oh my goodness.
296,10/26/2016,Jerome N.,louisville-3,5,"This place is amazing! At first I was skeptical because I'm not really a popsicle fan and usually the flavors aren't all that great.Their policy here is if you don't like what you got, they can replace it with another one without any charge. I love it! Now that's amazing customer service. The employees were great at their job.I got the plum with rosemary. It is exactly what it is named. It's like eating cold plum with rosemary bits. The rosemary really made it taste a bit unique but it wasn't too much that it would've been unbearable. It was the right amount of both flavors.I tried their pumpkin. I don't really like pumpkin but this one was creamy, smooth, rich, and sweet. It's really good. It taste exactly like pumpkin but on the sweeter side.I tried the rhubarb. I would not recommend this one. It didn't taste like anything at all. I think they should take this flavor down.I tried the smoked fig and cheese. This one was my favorite. It was so creamy and tasted so good. I couldn't really tasted the smoked fig but the cheese was so present."
297,7/24/2016,Shana K.,louisville-3,4,"I just can't fully jump on the Steel City bandwagon.  The popsicles are the best around.  However, one will set you back $3-4.50 which is kind of crazy for just one popsicle.  I've bought a few of the popsicles at  various festivals (where all food prices are high) and been glad for the cool relief.  For now I'll probably skip the store and just look for them at events."
298,7/3/2016,Javier O.,louisville-3,5,"I first tried Steel City Pops when they were at the Jefferstontown Craft Beer Fest.  I had already heard great things from everyone about the pops at this point but just hadn't made it down to their store in the Highlands. That changed yesterday when I took the kiddos for the full Steel City Pops experience.  We got there on a pleasant Saturday afternoon and as expected the line extended outside the door. The line ( as we got in the door we saw that there were two lines inside) moved fast for how many people were there.  About 10 minutes for about 30 people. As we got inside and waited, the kiddos and I kept entertained by reading the tv displays that were made to look like chalkboards.  There we read things such as that the pops are only naturally sweetened and that the pops have no artificial anything and that it's okay to not like a certain pop as you can return it for another flavor. After trying a couple different flavors now though, I doubt I would not like any of the rest.  So it was our turn to order and we chose The Raspberry Lemon and Sweet Tea on the Fruity Section of the menu and the youngest chose Chocolate from the Creamy Section.  Each pop is $3 or you can choose a cookie pop for a couple more dollars.  We were told the cookie pops are like creamy pops with a cookie in the middle. Most people go outside to eat their pops as the inside can feel a bit cramped with all the people trying to get in the door.  We sat down at one of the benches and proceeded to pull the pop out of the already cut bottom. I was so surprised that a sweet tea pop could pack on so much great flavor.  The kiddos were very happy with their choices as well.  The youngest tried to beat the melting process and eat the entire creamy pop but the pop is large and she soon needed the napkins she had grabbed. It caused some giggles and ultimately a great family time memory. Our time was almost up at the parking meter on Highland Avenue so we headed to the car maneuvering through the new crowd of people trying to get in the door. These pops remind me of all the ""Paletas"" I used to find at all the Mexican stores and restaurants when I lived in California.  As far as I know there isn't any other place like this in town. Great tasting pops, inexpensive prices, and chill location. Steel City Pops= creating great memories with friends and family over a delicious treat!"
299,10/22/2016,Alessandra D.,louisville-3,4,"I've been hearing a lot about Steel City Pops so I decided it was time to give it a try. As soon as I walked inside I noticed how passionate the employees were about the product and the flavors so that was pretty exciting. I had the strawberry lemonade popsicle which was good but at almost $4 each, a little pricey. I would definitely go back but I would suggest trying a more exotic flavor instead of one you can find at a store."
300,7/10/2016,Lamin S.,louisville-3,5,"I sparingly use the cliché ""OMG"" BUT OMG! Steel City Pops is just one those experiences! Handmade popsicles! Yes! 3 bucks a pop but worth every nickle! I had the peach popsicle which was like eating a freshly picked Georgia peach, frozen! Lush, the popsicle never got borig from start to finish! Great spot, smack in the middle of the Highlands along the Baxter Av/Bardstown Rd drag, great bench seating outside to enjoy a popsicle with friends and people watch! Also the staff were fabulous,  helping navigate the menu.  Anytime I'm back in Louisville, Steel City Pops will be a stop!"
301,7/3/2017,brian m.,louisville-3,3,Ya I just don't get it. I find the popsicle things to be mediocre. Kids behind the counter are helpful. But flavors always seem to be lacking for me.
302,8/25/2016,Killian H.,louisville-3,5,"Delicious! All I can say! Some great flavors, both fruity pops and cream based ones. Line can get a bit long, but it's well worth the wait!"
303,8/5/2016,Marciana G.,louisville-3,5,"Steel city pops was melt in your mouth goodness. My kids got peach, and I received the newer flavor, peaches and cream. Tastebud nirvana. It was a 93 degree day, but I would have eaten it in -50 degree weather. It was so peachy and creamy, without tasting icy. I am excited to return and try some more."
304,10/7/2016,Shelley S.,louisville-3,5,"Love this cute little Popsicle store! Lots of variety from fruity to creamy! New options frequently. Seasonal flavors too! Newest one maple bacon bourbon. My family chose chocolate, cranberry orange, cookies and cream and toasted marshmallow. Calories are also listed on the menu board. This place gets busy at times and has limited seating. Seating options both inside and out. Very clean. Also a viewing option to their kitchen. Great quality and service. Be sure to get a steel city pops punch card. Free pop after you buy 10!"
305,7/12/2016,Carly S.,louisville-3,5,"We stopped into Steel City after a meal and a few beers at Holy Grale, and I'm so glad we did! I can't do dairy, so a fruit-based pop was perfect for me. I tried the Lavender Lemonade. Delish. Ben had a creamy coffee pop and he loved it as well. We sat inside and watched as people came in, grabbed a pop and kept walking to their destinations or cars.We loved our pops so much that we got a to go bag with avocado pops (incredible and vegan) a sweet tea pop (refreshing) and a vanilla bean cookie pop (different but yummy) I think it is safe to say we will be stopping at Steel City whenever we are in the area. We have already been talking about which ones we want to try next."
306,3/2/2017,Ethan G.,louisville-3,5,"This little popsicle shop makes strolling down Bardstown a real hazard...because you will magically find yourself stepping inside whether you meant to or not.  Never have popsicles been better!Whether it's the range of flavors, the topping options, or the tip-top customer service, this place has it all.  I have yet to take them up on their offer to return a flavor I didn't enjoy (but remember, they do offer that option).  Have fun with the topping options that are offered.  Dip, Dust, Dredge, & Drizzle to your little heart's desire!"
307,7/15/2017,Kara K.,louisville-3,5,"I visited this place last night with my husband and some friends and I am really glad I did. I've heard that the line is usually out the door but around 8:00 p.m., it was steadily busy but not insane (apparently, we were the only people not at Forecastle). Anyway, back to the pops. Super delicious and refreshing. It was a tough choice what to pick because I seriously wanted to try like five flavors. I had the buttermilk and it was insanely good, husband had the blueberry basil and loved it. Our friends tried the coffee and strawberry lemonade and raved. I have heard the cookie ones are too die for. While these popsicles arent exactly health food, they are a good alternative if you are trying to satisfy a major sweet tooth without breaking the (calorie bank). I will be back."
308,6/23/2016,Lindsey S.,louisville-3,5,"One of the best additions on Bardstown Rd!My friend and I, after an evening shift at work, headed over to this delectable establishment and were beyond excited to finally try it out! Of course, it was a nice evening, and the place was hopping! People of all ages were waiting in line, and also lingering outside. You can tell that everyone was pleased with their popsicle choice!That was, quite honestly, the hardest part, for there are so many choices!I somewhat copped out and did the vanilla bean, an easy flavor. My friend did the pineapple jalapeno, wanting to take a flavor challenge.We took a bite and were MADLY in love! The flavors were so delicious and you can tell how fresh the ingredients were for making the popsicles! We were both so pleased, and the price was worth it! I have to say, this is defintely one of my favorite go-to dessert places! Especially since they love hearing feedback from their customers, and are always trying out new flavors!All in all, this place is amazing and try a flavor you may never get, you won't regret it! ;D"
309,8/1/2016,Robert D.,louisville-3,5,"The popsicles here are a must for any Bardstown road outing! The lines are usually long, but don't worry, they move quickly. Remember, they are just ordering a popsicle! Every popsicle I've gotten here was delicious and well worth a stop in. I recommend trying a cookie pop or one from the creamy side. Their menu is seasonal and changes often. They always replace it with great new flavors! I hate change, but getting a Popsicle makes it better."
310,6/29/2017,James C.,louisville-3,5,Vey good Need to try it. All the stuff is made fresh. They even have ones for people that can't eat milk. It's a must when people visit.
311,5/19/2016,Verna U.,louisville-3,4,Simple concept. Clean execution. Tidy place. Pleasant and quick service. Get a punch card: 10 punches and you get a free pop.Strawberry lemonade pop for $3 was delish. Boyfriend enjoyed piña colada pop. Will frequent.
312,7/9/2017,Jordan H.,louisville-3,5,This place had some amazing pops! The best I ever had! Just walking down the street you see everyone with one in there hands. Very impressive place
313,2/8/2017,K S.,louisville-3,5,"So, so good. I wish I had more time to try even more of the pops but I didn't. It's a good thing for me that I don't live nearby.I had a strawberry lemonade. Delicious. My partner-in-crime had a flavor I thought would be disgusting and that was delicious too. I don't think you can go wrong."
314,12/31/2016,Morgan E.,louisville-3,4,"I've had Steel City Pops on several occasions and each time has been great! No matter how busy they are, the service is always quick and friendly. The prices are reasonable at $3 for a large popsicle. I prefer the fruit flavors as opposed to the cream flavors. Each time I've gotten a cream flavor - I've wished I'd gotten the watermelon, raspberry lemon, or lavender lemonade. I wouldn't recommend the cookies and cream - there were entire cookies in the popsicle. It was just too much for me.  It's a great summer treat and don't be discouraged by the line out the door - it moves very quickly."
315,6/13/2017,Nate A.,louisville-3,3,"I gave it a three, because while my pop- the pineapple jalapeño was good, my wife's, the chocolate brownie tasted almost freezer burnt."
316,6/24/2017,Amberly R.,louisville-3,1,"I'm so tired of people raving about this place.  Support local businesses, go to Cocoberry pops!"
317,5/30/2016,Damian M.,louisville-3,5,"Really really really good. If you get the chance, try them. I like the creamy ones and tried the buttermilk and coffee. Buttermilk was AMAZING, tasted like a good quality yogurt."
318,5/27/2017,Mandy T.,louisville-3,5,"Everything is gluten free and it's a blessing!!! Had the cookies and cream pop, it was creamy and the cookies were just churchy enough to break through the cream but not so much that it's off putting. Haven't had cookie n' creme anything in years and it was worth the wait for this pop. Next time I'll try the grapefruit!!"
319,8/13/2016,Michelle W.,louisville-3,5,"What? A joint just for popcicles? Sign me up! The place was crowded but the workers were efficient in navigating the chaos. After asking random people what was good, I got a lavender lemonade popcicle  with the promise that if I didn't like it, I could replace it for a different flavor. No need! It was lavendery, lemonadey, and all around delicious. Definitely worth navigating the swarms of satisfied customers."
320,6/2/2016,Joey S.,louisville-3,5,"I waited way too long to get on the Steel City train, but all aboard, cause I am blowing the horn for the whole city to hear. If you haven't heard of Steel City Pops then you have not been on Instagram for a realllly long time (search #steelcity and I'm sure you'll find a ton of pictures of people posing with their fresh Popsicles). I'm not sure how often they make their pops, but I think it's every day cause I see snapchats of my friends going there and watching them being made, although I have never seen the live action. The company itself is doing great things in the community, hiring deaf workers, making all natural pops, selling water that benefits communities from around the world- WOW! Totally impressed with how they are impacting the world by making pops!Besides good business and amazing service, the pops are to die for. When you walk in you will notice there are two different types of pops (Fruity and Creamy) with a list of different flavors under each. The two times I have been I took a flavorful journey with watermelon and lavender lemonade with 0 regrets. All pops are made in-shop with fresh ingredients, and you can tell. No more spongebob gumball pops! Steel City only!!If you ever find yourself on Bardstown Rd, make a quick stop (and I mean quick, they get you in and out fast) and try one of these delicious pops. And while you're there, ask for a loyalty card! 10 punches gets you a free pop for your next visit"
321,4/26/2016,Andrea B.,louisville-3,3,"Steel City Pops is a cute little storefront that fits in great in the Highlands. We recently tried it on a nice night and it was packed. Lots of people waiting and sitting outside enjoying popsicles. I got the Toasted Coconut and it was really, really good. Probably the best popsicle I've ever had. But for $3, I'm not sure I would pick this over ice cream. I also really don't know how Steel City Pops will stay afloat in the winter because the last thing I want when it's cold is something really cold. They don't offer much else except coffee but there are plenty of coffee options around. Maybe they plan to expand offerings? I know they have other locations, so hopefully they've figured this all out.In case they want my ideas...I think selling ""pup""sicles and ""spiked""sicles could appeal to more people and keep them returning. Being a person that loves my dog a little too much, the appeal of taking my pup to get a pupsicle would probably keep me coming back more than going just for myself."
322,4/17/2016,McKenzie I.,louisville-3,5,"I'm so in love with Steel City Pops in Louisville, and the line wrapped around the building tells me that lots of other people are, too! I visited on Friday, loved it so much that I ventured back to the Highlands to enjoy it a second night in a row. Lemme give you a lil' rundown: $3-$4.50 pops made in house with the freshest ingredients, all natural, no artificial ANYTHING. The flavor combinations are so delicious and refreshing. They have two categories of pops, fruity or creamy. The fruity side of the menu is light, refreshing, and comes in averaging only 100 calories per pop and they are not small, you definitely get your money's worth and you feel satisfied. The creamy side is more decadent, with rich vanilla or chocolate, and ranges from about 150 calories to 300. If you dig ice cream more than pops, try the vanilla chocolate chip with a chocolate chip cookie inside or the chocolate brownie, with a brownie nestled inside of it. It will definitely satisfy your need for a heavier sweet treat. The vanilla chocolate chip was delicious, but so filling I couldn't even finish the whole thing when I tried it!Sure the line is long, but it moves quick! And the employees are sooooo friendly and sweet. A definite plus for somewhere that I will literally spend my last $3.00 at, oh and if you only have three dollar bills, that's cool, the price includes the tax! Also, all of the fruity pops are completely VEGAN! So, you know, if you're into that this will be your haven for hot summer days.Overall: An excellent place to grab a treat on hot days, but I'm sure it will still be a popping spot come fall and winter, because in addition to the pops they also serve espresso and coffee drinks. I've enjoyed the blood orange, blackberry, blueberry cream, and the vanilla chocolate chip pops and my absolute favorite is the blood orange. All of these pops have texture and are not drippy at all. Go and try one for yourself, I'll see you in line!"
323,4/22/2016,Amanda J.,louisville-3,5,"Steel City Pops does what is does well. $3 popsicles in fruity and creamy varieties, plus a couple cake pop options. It's really pretty simple. It might take you a minute to decide what you want, but otherwise, it's in and out. (I would imagine even if there was a line it would move quickly.) I've been a couple times now and have had the hibiscus and blackberry flavors. Both were refreshing and low on calories. Plus, the blackberry one had seeds in it, which I love. I tried a friend's kid's creamy peanut butter one today. I enjoyed that was well, but I prefer the fruity ones in general. I'm glad to have Steel City in Louisville. I'll be back! Pro tip: Get a loyalty card to get a free pop or pack after so many visits."
324,11/22/2016,Mona T.,louisville-3,5,"I knew about Steel City Pops years ago.  A friend had suggested it to me for my Birmingham list. Then, lo and behold, Louisville had the good fortune of getting one here!  The fruity popsicles are seasonal and frequently change out in flavors. I've had the strawberry lemonade, the iced tea, the mint julep, the lavender lemonade, the ginger ale, the root beer, the watermelon.  The creamy ones also have a variety of flavors: avocado, buttermilk (their signature), cookies 'n cream... Oh, and let's not forget the cookie pops. What are those you ask?  Well, they come with cookies that are surrounded by a popsicle! How can it get any better than that?  Well, they found a way.  You can dunk, drizzle, dredge, and dust your popsicle in a variety of options to make it even better.  Oh, and want to take the popsicle to go?  No problem, they will pack it in a nice container with some dry ice for you so your popsicle doesn't melt. How can it get any better? Let me count the ways I love this place.  Steel City, you know I'll be back."
325,4/7/2016,Brad G.,louisville-3,5,"5-stars! All day! I've only been once but that's enough to know that I'll be going back often. I didn't realize that a popsicle could taste so good. On the day I went I decided to walk to Chipotle for a burrito. A Steel City Pop was the perfect dessert to follow my burrito. I wasn't sure on what flavor I wanted (I almost ordered 2 or 3 at once). I ultimately decided to go with Blood Orange. WOW! I didn't stick around to eat it because the front of the store was full of people. It wasn't until later that I realized they have seating in the back! I assume this place would be fun with a date similar to getting frozen yogurt, ice cream, or boba. It's also a great grab and go place. The transaction happened within a minute or two and I was on my way. A popsicle is the perfect treat to walk down the street with if you're trying to make it somewhere else. Popsicles are 3 bucks which might seem expensive for a popsicle, but these popsicles are large. You won't be disappointed. Go there! Eat one or three! You can also buy in bulk. They have boxes and little ice packs. I'm curious to see how they hold up."
326,4/11/2016,Mac B.,louisville-3,5,"Ok, first off, Holy Crap!  These pops are awesome!I've been reading great reviews of Steel City Pops and I bookmarked it, because... Ice Cream!While at the Flea Off Market I noticed Steel City had a small cart where they sold some of their pops.  Without question, I had to have one.  I didn't care if it was cold outside and it may have been a little too cool for ice pops.  I had to try one!I had the strawberry & lemonade pop and now I know what the fuss is all about.  This pop is one of the tastiest pops I've ever had.  It wasn't too sweet and I could taste the natural flavor of the strawberries.  The seeds at the top of the pop was a nice introduction into the bliss that is a Steel City pop.After this pop, I'm definitely stopping by their shop and having a fresh one made.  I can only image how great it will taste."
327,4/1/2016,Karen R.,louisville-3,5,"One of the ""coolest"" concepts that I'm welcoming with open arms has finally came to our city! Woohoo! And with perfect timing because, well, Popsicle season is upon us. I've been to several Popsicle places while on vacation and I'm happy to report that Steel City Pops is just as good, if not better. They have fruit pops and creamy pops (and calories listed for your info ... which I LOVE).I got the blackberry pop: sweet and full of blackberry goodness. Just perfect. My husband got the coconut pop: it was SOOOO good that I wanted to cry. Does that happen to anyone else?? He also ordered the toasted marshmallow: VERY good. But after having the coconut, it's hard to go for anything else.Each pop is $3. They also have a frequent buyers card where they'll punch a hole for each pop you buy and after so many, you get a FREE pop. Hello! I'll be burning through those faster than popsicles melt ... The staff was so friendly even when being super busy.  I do wish the front was bigger because there wasn't really somewhere for a ""line"" to place an order. There were 6 of us in ""line"" and we were just kind of standing where we could. And when the busier months come, I'm curious on how they'll work that out ... But if the end result is one of their Popsicles, I'll stand on the roof if I have too."
328,5/20/2017,Jessica C.,louisville-3,5,Stopped by on a hot Saturday afternoon. They have seating inside and outside. Today I got their cookies and cream cookie pop. Super yummy! The size of the pop is large enough to satisfy anyone. They are consistently delicious! Always a crowd favorite!
329,4/16/2016,Shanita B.,louisville-3,5,Ok so i used my family to come with me so i can try more than just one flavor so i tried blueberry cream yummm...family had vanilla bean...toasted marshmallows... buttercream..all ohhh sooo good. And thy had tasters of pineapple jalapeno and avocado thy where good. I really don't think there is a nasty flavor..i will be back..
330,4/30/2016,Sarah C.,louisville-3,5,"A popsicle shop cannot receive anything less than 5 stars as long as they are frozen and tasty!  This spot boasts both!  :)I had the hibiscus on my first visit and loved it.  Perfectly flavored and priced about what I would have expected.  $3 for a real popsicle is par, right?  If you have some friends, or a huge appetite you can get a price break on 4 pops!  :)I want to try so many of these.  I like how they have the menu divided into categories such as fruit, cream, etc.  It is helpful since there are so many different ones to choose from. They also have some coffee to warm you up or wake you up, whichever you may be in the market for during your visit.  Be prepared for a line, friends.  This is a popular new spot on Bardstown Road and it shows in the form of people waiting.  Worth it!"
331,4/3/2016,Rebecca C.,louisville-3,4,"New to town, Steel City Pops offers gourmet popsicles in a vast variety of flavors.  They've turned our old Louisville favorite, Wild and Woolly, into a place to get a sweet treat and walk down the beautiful streets of the Highlands.The popsicles are reasonably priced at around $3 each, and come in around a little less than 100 calories.  We decided to try two pops and bought the Pineapple-Jalapeno and the coffee popsicles.  They are actually quite large popsicles and thankfully don't melt too easily.  Both popsicles had a delicious flavor, and the coffee popsicle even tasted a little milky and creamy more like an ice cream on a stick.  The pineapple-jalapeno also didn't disappoint, although as a lover of spice, I would have liked a better jalapeno kick.Seating is limited and the storefront was a little crowded on a Saturday afternoon.  However, the lines went quick and we were even offered a ""punch card"" to enjoy 10 popsicles with your 11th being free.  A good addition to the Highlands and Louisville as a whole."
332,4/9/2016,Mike A.,louisville-3,5,"Popsicle, Popsicle, popsicle, popsicle, popsicle popsicle....yum. Sorry but this place just brings the kid out in me. Went with the family to check out the buzz and omg what a great concept. This was the best Popsicle any of us had ever had. I tried the lime cucumber and it was very refreshing. When we arrived the line was long but moved at lightening speed. Very friendly attentive staff. What I really liked was the Popsicle was more satisfying than ice cream without the guilt. My Popsicle was just barely over 100 calories and my daughters strawberry lemonade  was under 100 calories. Large selection of Popsicles. There is even a marshmallow Popsicle. Popsicles are $3 a piece which may sound pricey but when compared to ice cream is on the cheap side."

Updated review",Tina T.,louisville-3,4,"It just open and there's already a flood of people. $3 exactly per pop. Unless you buy a box of them.They had two different pop menus : Fruity vs Creamy. I haven't tried any creamy popsicles since I tend to go toward the Guidry flavored though. I tried mango & blackberry (seedy). The sweet tea pop taste like Mcd sweet tea. They also give out those cards stamps, I think you buy 10 or 11 pops and you get the next one free. There's more seat in the back of the place and both sides."
334,4/9/2016,Regina P.,louisville-3,5,"We could not wait to try this place and it didn't disappoint!  I went with my daughter and husband and we all LOVED our Popsicles.  You can choose from juicy, creamy, or cookie Popsicle choices.  I chose the smoked marshmallow and it was heavenly!  It had a bit of a caramel flavor to it which is alright by me!I loved the decor and the ladies working there were super helpful and nice.  One even came over to see how we liked our Popsicles.  It was crowded on a cool night, so I anticipate big crowds when the warmer temperatures arrive.This is a winner and we will be back!  Such a nice alternative to ice cream."
335,7/11/2016,Taylor B.,louisville-3,5,"I know what you're thinking - it's just a popsicle, can it be that great? Well, it is. I love Steel City Pops! The storefront is simple, clean and bright. The employees have always been more than kind. The popsicles are off the charts! My favorite is the rosemary lemonade popsicle, but I've pretty much liked everything popsicle I've ever gotten there. This is definitely a company that cares for both its employees and its customers."
336,4/18/2016,Raymond B.,louisville-3,5,"Steel City Pops is the newest eatery in the Bardstown road restaurant corridor. Weirdly, Steel City Pops didn't originate in Pittsburgh, which is what I thought since they have the ""Steel City"" right in their name.  They are actually from Birmingham, Alabama, which was also a center for steel manufacturing.  By visiting I learned something new (although to be fair I learned that from Wikipedia not from Steel City Pops).  Regardless of the name, they have some pretty great pops. My wife and I decided to stop by Steel City Pops on Saturday night.  The weather was warm and the place was extremely crowded, however because the ""pops"" are pre-packaged the line moved very quickly and we soon reached the counter.  Their menu is split into two different kinds of pops, fruity and creamy and the pops are all 3 dollars.  If the descriptions on the menu are anything to go by the fruity pops are pretty healthy clocking in at about 100 calories, with the Blackberry fruity pop being only 87 calories.  Since we were celebrating the successful planting of two shrubberies, we decided to splurge on the creamy pops, which aren't quite as good for you, but are definitely delicious.  I tried the Vanilla Bean pop and my wife the Blueberry Cream.  The Vanilla Bean really did taste like vanilla bean, there was a slight almost chalky after taste, but that didn't take away from the flavor or the taste.  I also tried a bite of my wife's Blueberry Cream.  Both the pops tasted great.   I greatly enjoyed my Steel City Pop and I'll definitely be back to try some of the fruity flavors.  Although there a multitude of places to get cold desserts and snacks on Bardstown road, Steel City Pops definitely adds something unique to the area."
337,4/13/2017,Sheridan G.,louisville-3,5,"I LOVE this place. The flavors are amazing and changing every few week so there is always something new to try. They have both a fruity menu, which is like your traditional popsicles, and a creamy menu, which is basically ice cream on a stick but BETTER! They are $3 a pop and one is very filling. The portions are VERY generous. You can buy pops in a 4 bag or 12 in a cooler to take home and it will make it an hour or so before needed to be in a freezer. The staff is great! They are very friendly and helpful with flavor recommendations. I love the drizzle and dusting. The chocolate they dunk in it is much like the hard shell chocolate syrup from your childhood. My go to flavors so far is: Vanilla bean, chocolate, strawberry lemonade, and any of the cookie pops. There is seating inside, which tends to go fast on the weekends. There is seating on the sides in front of big windows where you can watch the staff make the pops in their kitchen. There is limited outdoor bench seating. Definitely give this place a try!"
338,4/2/2016,Sara C.,louisville-3,4,"The Popsicles were very good, I had Strawberry Lemonade and my sister had Peanut Butter they were both delicious. These frozen treats will be great for the summer. The price is $3 or 4 for $11. I like the idea of Popsicles but that and coffee is really all they serve."
339,8/30/2016,Kellyo O.,louisville-3,5,"Dang! I love this place. I know it is expensive but it is so darn good! I love the coconut with the toasted coconut on the bottom and top. Such creamy goodness!!! I missed the avocado pops and I am so incredibly bummed that I did! I did get the curry pop and that was also fantastic. The only pop that I didn't like was at the beginning of summer I got a watermelon that was icky. and no, I didn't trade it in. That's just crazy. My kiddo loves the lavender lemonade and hasn't ventured away since she tried it a month ago. Yes Steel City, I will be back because I am stuck to you like a kid who stuck her tongue on a frozen popsicle. ;)"
340,5/10/2016,Dung T.,louisville-3,5,"The most addictive and adventurous popsicle you'll find in town.  These handmade pops will brighten up your day and cool down your hot summer. I have been here many times now and I have yet to be disappoint with any of their many favors.  The space is cozy and if you get lucky enough, you can sit and watch them make the pops fresh out of their kitchen while having a treat yourself.  The employees are as sweet as the pops and serving them with a warm smile and very helpful in making the right choice.I highly recommend the mango, it's like they took a fresh mango put it on a stick and stuck it in the freezer.    So be daring and try something new and if you don't like it after the first bite, which is not very likely, they will let you get a new one."
341,8/7/2017,Michael W.,louisville-3,5,"These great people just provided the desserts for our son's wedding rehearsal dinner in Louisville, and it was wonderful.  They were so professional and easy to work with, affordable, and the pops were super.  Our guests loved them.  Very highly recommended!  Thanks, Hunter!"
342,10/11/2016,Lokman G.,louisville-3,4,"It's at the busiest spot in town on weekend night, right at the intersection of Baxter and Bardstown Road. The popsicles are handmade with all-natural or certified organic ingredients, and of course, with this saying the price is little higher than those pops you could get form grocery store. Each pop is $3, or $4.5 for those with cookie. If you are in a larger group, you have the option to order the 12-pops bag for a discounted price. We went on a Saturday night after dinner, and it was packed with long line going around inside the small store. However, the lines moved pretty quick, and everyone was quick (pick, pay, and go). Chocolate pop was ok, which I personally think it can be richer in flavor. Cookies and Cream was good. It has big chunk of cookie in the pop, which make it very filling. I could barely finish entire one right after dinner. One downside is that there is no room to sit inside of the store, and limited seating are outside of the store. Will definitely go back to try out more flavors!"
343,4/13/2017,Heidi L.,louisville-3,5,"I'm not even a big fan of popsicles....I think of ""bomb pops"" or ""juicy juice pops"" and it's not enticing.  BUT.....then I walked into Steel City Pops and my WHOLE life changed.  Popsicles are now one of my favorite desserts BECAUSE OF Steel City Pops.  We even chose to forgo the traditional wedding cake and are now having a popsicle cart, vendor, and 160 popsicles for our June 2017 wedding!!!!!  We could not be more thrilled.  I am obsessed with their cookies n' cream, peanut butter, and carrot cake pops.  If you're trying to decide whether to go here or ANYWHERE else, my main point: GO HERE.  You won't regret it :)"
344,4/27/2017,Jeffery H.,louisville-3,5,"Being from Birmingham, I love having a taste of home up here in Kentucky. Avocado and buttermilk are our favs!"

Updated review",Logan M.,louisville-3,5,"Steel City Pops is a great stop in the Highlands neighborhood - pop in for dessert, an afternoon snack, or take a bag of pops home. The staff is incredible and the vibe inside is unique and trendy. Exposed bricks and beams give a feel for the original building. Enjoy fruity or creamy pops, all of them are $3, and they are made right in the store. You can also start a loyalty card and get free pops after a few visits. This place is going to take over Kentucky! I love it!"
346,8/19/2016,Natasha R.,louisville-3,5,"I'm eating a coffee popsicle to cool down as my lunch break because my job involves a lot of driving around in the heat. I'm in heaven! I really ought to just buy a case of 12 ($33) to leave at home for my morning coffee. There are a ton of flavors and every time I try one I think there can't be a better flavor, but then I try another flavor.... It's a good place to come alone, it's a good place to come with friends. Cool your mouth down here after eating spicy stuff at La Que,  or for fun dessert after dinner at Jack Fry's."
347,3/27/2017,Leslie H.,louisville-3,5,Had the cookies and cream...yummy! Next time I am definitely getting it dipped! Maybe some almonds. So delish!
348,6/11/2017,Carissa H.,louisville-3,5,"Super yummy and fun atmosphere. I got the strawberry cream and it was like eating ice-cream of a Popsicle stick. They also have a reward program where if you buy 10 popsicles, you get 1 free. I thought that was a super cool idea. They also are all gluten free and have calories labeled under each flavor. They do make vegan popsicles as well. Would recommend!"
349,7/23/2016,Michelle C.,louisville-3,5,"Ok, if you haven't been here just go. They've got TONS of flavors so you're bound to find something that you like. We've been here more times then I can count. We usually get the 4 pack because we'll get one for our dogs to share. It comes in a cute little bag with an ice pack. If you get a 12 pack it comes in a nice little Styrofoam cooler for you to take them home in.We got 3 12 packs for my husbands birthday party and they were nice enough to label all of them. They're super speedy and efficient. I tend to steer towards the tea flavors (chai tea, sweet tea, champagne white tea), but my husband loves the creamy ones (cherry sour cream, strawberry cookie pop, coconut). I love that we can go and get a semi healthy dessert - all of their fruit pops are pretty low in calories.AND they make them all in house! You can watch them while you eat your popsicle. They even have traveling carts so if you have a wedding or family reunion and need a bunch they'll come to you!"
350,8/5/2016,Jessica A.,louisville-3,5,My son and I love them! We went and got a 4 pop pack and tried 4 flavors. They even have a punch card for regular visits to earn free pops. I love the creamy flavors but the champagne white tea pop was very sweet!
351,8/13/2016,Dimple P.,louisville-3,4,"At first I wasn't completely sold on the whole steel city pop craze. I mean, it's just a popsicle right? Ummm no, it's more than that! As soon as you walk in, you're in a happy place. The open kitchen is awesome and you can watch them make popsicles in house. They have a great selection of flavors, both fruity and creamy and if you're not satisfied with your flavor, they will happily let you pick another choice...not that you will ever be disappointed! Definitely a fun treat to grab and stroll around in the highlands on a nice summer evening. The coffee flavor is my favorite so far!"
352,3/14/2017,Alex M.,louisville-3,4,The popsicles were great! The line went by real fast! I would recommend this place to anyone who wants great ice cream and great service!
353,3/5/2017,Rachael G.,louisville-3,5,"My boyfriend and I just visited this establishment and were greeted with smiles and happy workers all around. Keep in mind this is at 8pm on Sunday, when I'm sure all these kids would much rather be home with their families. Every time I've ever come in, (which is multiple times a week when it's warm) everyone is happy warm helpful and knowledgeable of the menu. On top of this the place is VERY clean and pleasing to the eye. Thanks!"
354,8/6/2016,Mel G.,louisville-3,5,"Yes, I will give you a 5 star rating even though you're just a popsicle. I had the champagne white tea and it was delightful. Lasted longer than I thought a popsicle would and had me very curious about the other flavors offered -- a sign of success, methinks."
355,10/27/2016,Jordan C.,louisville-3,3,"I love the vanilla. However the other flavors just arnt for me really! If you love ice cream that does not mean you will love these. Pricey but that's beside the point with the experience.100% worth a try, it's a great place to go hang out by baxters ave."
356,6/10/2016,Tara T.,louisville-3,4,"Wow, I have heard nothing but rave reviews of this place, and they are well deserved! I came in to get 4 pops to go, and found out that they have a deal for that - $11 for 4 pops, and they come in a nice little insulated bag with an ice pack. I had a hard time choosing between the flavors because there were so many that sounded appealing. I had to pick for 3 other people, so I got a lavender lemonade for my SO who loves all things lavender, a buttermilk and a pina colada. Oh, and a jasmine green tea for myself, because it's my absolute favorite flavor of everything, so I didn't have much of a choice. There were so many that sounded good, namely coffee, sweet tea, chai, and cherry sour cream. I tried all of the pops that I bought and the buttermilk was out of this world. It was so unique, and indulgent. I'm still craving that flavor!The menu is separated by ""creamy"" and ""fruity"" flavors. Interestingly the jasmine green tea was made as a creamy pop, and it worked really well. The sweet tea is a ""fruity"" one though (ie no dairy), and that sounds really yummy and refreshing. They have a punch card system, but there are separate punches for the bags of 4, and single pops, which I was disappointed by, because I will probably typically stop in for one pop, and I feel like $11 is steep for popsicles, even though they are delicious.  The employees were super pleasant, and I came at an off time so I can't vouch for the crowd, but I'm sure it gets busy. The service is quick though, so don't let that keep you away!"
357,7/12/2016,Dana C.,louisville-3,5,It's not like any Popsicle you have ever had got $3 and it is worth every penny. We were visiting from North Carolina and saw the line... So we got in the line... WOW! It was worth the wait.
358,7/9/2016,Justyna B.,louisville-3,5,"Definitely worth the hype! Best ice pops I've ever had! The green tea, horchata, and pomegranate are all excellent choices :-) honestly $3 isn't bad at all. Back home in NYC, ice pops are $4 and taste bland."
359,5/12/2016,Kristie T.,louisville-3,5,"When I told the kids I was going to get them a popsicle after dinner they looked at me like I was nuts.  They're not and I'm not popsicle lovers, but because of all the Yelp reviews I knew we had to try it especially since we were right next door anyway.  So, we went in and ordered our peanut butter and chocolate popsicles and left.  We were all so happy with our choices and I loved that it was more of an ice creamy type pop than what I was expecting.  I was very happy with how quick and cheap the whole process was.  They had lots of choices, but it was simple at the same time which I loved."
360,2/3/2017,Katelynn M.,louisville-3,5,"Love this place! I've tried a new pop every time and never been disappointed, especially with a reasonable price. Almost always busy in the summer but you can still get in and out quickly. Nice to be able to walk down Bardstown Rd. eating your pop!"
361,5/1/2016,Michael R.,louisville-3,5,"Well, if we had to lose Wild and Woolly, at least something cool (cold, even) took its spot. I tend to be more into ice cream than pops, but these are super great. They have some ""safe"" flavors, but they also have more interesting ones like avocado or pineapple jalepeno. I've been four times since they opened and I have not once been disappointed. I knew I would love the hibiscus--it's like a frozen jamaica agua fresca. The avocado is great. I got the chai latte once and it melted SUPER fast--not sure if it was just the one I got or if it's just a softer pop than some of the others. It was still tasty. The buttermilk was a real surprise--it's definitely my favorite creamy flavor so far. The texture of both the creamy and fruity pops is exceptionally good. I will for sure be a frequent visitor over the summer."
362,6/26/2016,Willie L.,louisville-3,5,This place is amazing. I got the coffee pop and it was delicious! Can't wait to try more. Would love to have a location in southern Indiana!
363,7/10/2016,Chris J.,louisville-3,5,Hey what a great place and the pops well that's the what all the buzz is about fresh creamy nice treat.  Line moves fast so don't be worried this place is buzzing.   Parking was a chore for us but worth th treat.   We got out pops and walked around to check out the other sites.  There is a flavor everyone and some ecnetric flavors too.   Give it a try you can't be disappointed and hey if you are you can't be pleased. Happy Eats

365,8/10/2016,Ashley W.,louisville-3,5,So good! I've had the watermelon and  the champagne & white tea. Both were great! Very hefty and dense in a good way! You get a lot of pop for your money!
366,6/18/2016,Liz Y.,louisville-3,5,"I absolutely love these pops! I also like that they have calorie information on their menu so that you can make an educated decision on what you're buying. I had the watermelon pop and my husband had passion fruit and they were both delicious. I've had the butter milk, blueberry basil, and pina colada before. They are all delicious!"
367,5/24/2017,Chip M.,louisville-3,4,I'm not used to the hot/humid combo that is summer in Louisville and these pops were a life saver. Had the hibiscus pop and the lemon cream pop...totally worth the trip. Every flavor sounded amazing and just makes the decision that much harder. Kitchen windows let you see the real ingredients going into the pops. Can't wait for my next trip to Louisville.
368,5/16/2016,Adam C.,louisville-3,4,"A simple idea+good execution = successThere is not much to it, a freezer full of pops at $3 to $4.50, straightforward menu with a one bite guarantee, all of this with quick and friendly service. It seems like they are always busy even though it only takes a minute to order and get your pops. I had the chocolate chip cookie pop, she had the buttermilk. Both are rich and creamy, but we each preferred the one we ordered. Buttermilk tasted just like cheesecake,her favorite, and chocolate chip was just sweet enough and very rich. Larger chips would have been nice(something like Graeter's would be perfect), but we both enjoyed every bite. I only give it 4 stars because after visiting Cincy last week I stumbled on to a very very similar Streetpops business. So what I thought was somewhat original turns out to be not so original. Still the finished product is good and storefront was done to perfection. I thought going in the price was a little much, but I guess the price point is about right. I mean how can you argue knowing another company has already proven the price point to be on the mark. The one thought I had after leaving was that this might be like the cupcake craze, but there seems to be a large demand for now. I know we will end up here again, just hoping to see some more creative flavors."
369,4/16/2016,Laura C.,louisville-3,4,"It was tragic to leave Atlanta and the epic King of Pops - with unique flavors, reliable presence at events and at the gas station at the corner of North Ave and Highland. But never fear, Louisville. Good pops are here. I had one at Flea on Market on a cloudy day. I liked that the selection, while not extensive, provided several good options, both dairy and dairy-free. The mango was awesome! The event pops weren't that creative, or at least the dairy-free ones. But you know what? I'm so happy to find very good pops, high-quality, and super-nice staff. Thanks!!!"
370,9/17/2016,John H.,louisville-3,5,OMG the best most luscious Popsicles ever!A variety of fruit and creamy flavored...my daughters fav is lavender lemon. I love buttermilk!Parking is challenging but worth the effort!
371,4/11/2016,Mckenzie M.,louisville-3,5,"HANDS DOWN the best treat! I lived in Birmingham for a year, and that's where I discovered Steel City Pops. Flash forward six years later, and my Popsicle dreams have come true. Steel City is a true gem when it comes to great customer service, all-natural and fresh ingredients, affordable pricing and delicious pops. I have to literally refrain from going every day. There's fruity, creamy and cookie pops. The fruity and creamy will run you $3 even, and the cookie pops are $4.50. My personal favorite is the coffee pop made with Octane Coffee. Anyone who's been to Birmingham should know how incredible Octane is. So do yourself a favor and grab a coffee with your pop."
372,2/21/2017,Beav P.,louisville-3,5,"I usually do not do a review after just one visit but c'mon, its a Popsicle! I had the strawberry lemonade pop on a hot summer day and it was delicious. I can wait to go back and try another. The fact that I'm even writing a review on a popsicle joint should be proof that it's worth trying."
373,5/12/2016,Scott C.,louisville-3,5,"Yum!Sometimes it's too good to take time for a pic before you devour it!Some really interesting flavors, if you don't like what you pick you can get something else."
374,5/22/2016,Carolyn W.,louisville-3,5,"Customer Service is found in Louisville! I probably shouldn't tell you this but we arrived about 15 minutes before they opened their doors. The staff saw us and showed us into their spotless interior as they described their concept and options. I was amazed. Open early to let a customer inside and then, even though other staff are doing the final preparation for the true opening time, one staff members walks us through their process! Way to go, Steel City Pops. We will be back.BTW: I got the Lime but it was not that different than regular lime popsicles so I would definitely venture to another flavor. My husband chose the Strawberry Lemonade (one of their best sellers) and it was perfect in texture and flavor (wasn't it nice that he let me taste it?). SCP will let you get a different pop if you aren't excited about the one you chose so I could have asked for a different flavor but felt like the lime was acceptable--and we had wandered away to explore another street. Both popsicles were refreshing."
375,7/1/2016,Kevin S.,louisville-3,5,Pineapple Jalapeno pops - nothing more needs to be said. But seriously try every single one.  They give you cute little insulated bags so you can take some home - which you should.

377,7/9/2016,J. W.,louisville-3,5,"Expensive, but worth it!  The customer service is great and so are the choices and popsicles!  I've had the strawberry and the chocolate brownie pops.  Great concept and location, I actually went the first time because I was eating at Bunz (another awesome establishment) and saw literally dozens of people walking by with popsicles.  I finally stopped a group of folks and after some chatting about their reviews of the place, had to stop in."

379,9/25/2016,Jeff P.,louisville-3,5,"A 5 star Yelp rating! Is Steel City Pops deserving of that lofty rating? I'd have to say, YES! Every time I've been I've enjoyed what I ordered. The popsicles are delicious and always hit the spot. The counter staff is friendly and helpful. You can sit inside and watch them making their treats in the back or sit outside and watch people. It is certainly a great addition to the Highlands."
380,12/22/2016,Laken C.,louisville-3,5,"This place is definitely a 5 star! I moved to Louisville in July, and I have seriously been there every week. Love it! The best part is, if you get a flavor that you don't like, you can get a new one! I also love that they constantly are doing new seasons flavors so that you never get tired of the ones they have. Annndddd, they are healthy!"
381,10/11/2016,Anastasia M.,louisville-3,5,Great popsicles and the staff is fantastic!  Had toasted marshmallow and chocolate when I was there.  Highly recommend!
382,5/2/2016,Parker R.,louisville-3,5,"Price is good for an organic based Popsicle, and the staff is very friendly. I've been a few times, and my husband wanted to try a new flavor and was on the fence about it, the lady at the counter encouraged him to try it and said they would give him a new one if he didn't like it. He tried it, took about 2 bites and ultimately decided he didn't like it, she replaced it no problem."
383,5/11/2016,Brittney H.,louisville-3,5,"Steel City Pops is in a prime location and they deliver a prime product! Despite the constant crowds and the rather small venue, this 'popsicle stand' handles it gracefully. I have had three different popsicles from this place and each one was amazing! At Steel City Pops, they have fruit pops and creamy pops (milk based pops! Chocolate, Marshmallow, etc) ranging anywhere from $3-4.50. I gotta say- flavors are pretty unique! So far, I have had Pineapple Jalapeño, Marshmallow, and Chocolate and I honestly couldn't tell you which one was my favorite. They were all delicious. On my last visit, I also purchased a t-shirt for $20 because that place is the bees knees! I would also like to mention that the girl that helped me was very knowledgable and made me feel comfortable asking questions. She also got me through the long line in under two minutes. I will definitely be back AND I'm bringing all of my friends! Support local business, y'all!"
384,6/19/2016,Robby W.,louisville-3,5,Had the strawberry lemonade which was amazing. Great service. My daughter has been here 3 days in a row and brought me here for Father's Day. I'll be coming back .
385,12/18/2016,Erica B.,louisville-3,5,"These popsicles are amazing!  I have had both the sweet tea popsicle, which tastes just like sweet tea, and the pumpkin popsicle, which is creamy pumpkin goodness.  I haven't tried a flavor I don't like.   It's a great place to visit when you're walking down Bardstown Road on a beautiful summer day."

Updated review",Jason R.,louisville-3,5,Idk what to say this place is awesome. We had strawberry lemonade. It never melts as you are eating it was great . They are super friendly. You can sit on side of the store and watch them make them from scratch. So cool . And you can get them to go with 30 min time frame to get them to your house
387,6/14/2016,Katie N.,louisville-3,5,"Was driving down Bardstown Road and saw a hoard of people outside so I talked my family into going with me the next day. Wow! The staff is friendly, the wait wasn't very long, a huge array of flavors, and a reasonable price for how big the Popsicles are. This shop is so cute, and the Popsicles were great with the weather being so hot. I got the cherry sour cream, and it was delicious. My 94 year old grandma loved her blueberry basil pop too!"
388,11/5/2016,Dustin W.,louisville-3,5,So good! Friendliest young staff every time I go. Plus Fair price but Worth it for a little liter type dessert after a good dinner when on bards town rd. Any nite!  Def going back. Plus they cater so that makes SCP even more awesomer!!  DW
389,12/4/2016,Chloe S.,louisville-3,4,"Fun place to go get a quick treat on a hot day. Even if it's packed the line moves quickly. The popsicles are a little expensive, but they're so good it's worth it. Try the creamy coconut pop-- it's amazing!"
390,7/22/2016,Derek J.,louisville-3,5,Best quality Popsicles I've ever had.  They don't lose their flavor like a normal Popsicle. Plus they have all sorts of unique flavors! Give it a try!
391,11/3/2016,Bryan T.,louisville-3,5,"Such a wonderful idea, and perfectly executed. No matter if you are feeling like indulging, or just a light treat they have a option for either. Also, updating the flavors to the season and constantly changing is a plus as well!"
392,8/25/2016,Heather W.,louisville-3,5,Amazing pops and wonderful customer service. Haven't had a flavor that I haven't liked yet. Love Steel City Pops!
393,8/22/2016,Kat M.,louisville-3,5,Delicious Popsicles I had the sweet curry and my sister had the horchata both were delish. The employees were very sweet and friendly. Very good highly recommend!!
394,8/30/2016,MareA D.,louisville-3,5,Super delicious simple ingredients. It's a great way to indulge without artificial ingredients.
395,10/21/2016,Jessica J.,louisville-3,5,Awesome pops and tons of variety. Even if there is a long line they work through it quickly!
396,5/17/2016,Ashley D.,louisville-3,5,"I'm getting a little addicted to Steel City Pops. It's so hard to resist their outrageously good flavors. The first time I went I got blood orange. I wanted to try the pineapple jalapeno, but told myself I couldn't justify eating two popsicles in one sitting (I've since justified it). My friend got the sweet tea pop on that visit and we both raved about them. Then I tried the strawberry lemonade at the Cherokee Triangle Art Festival. It was divine! On Mother's Day I convinced my mom I wanted to get her a treat and we went to Steel City. She was a little surprised by how many punches I'd acquired on my Steel City Pops card. It is almost full and I'm being an overachiever. I think she should be proud of me! They had just changed the menu so I didn't get to try the pineapple jalapeno or avocado (but I will when they make a comeback)! She had the lavender lemonade and I got the lime. They were excellent. We sat outside and chatted with two girls from Australia. They said they wished there was a popsicle store like this in their city. After chatting about just how wonderful our pops were, I convinced my mom we should get seconds. It was a great decision! She got the strawberry shortcake and I got the chocolate chip cookie. They are much richer than the regular pop, but oh-so-good!"
397,10/12/2016,Barbora S.,louisville-3,5,"great pops! they have ever some vegan options as well. Every time I pass by Steel City Pops, it is crowded and the lines are even outside of the store. Their pops are very refreshing and they areg also great alternative to regular sugar laden high calorie ice cream. The service professional, the line goes very fast. Their staff is always very nice and helpful."
398,6/23/2016,Chelsea A.,louisville-3,5,"Can't go wrong! Amazing flavors, fun atmosphere, excellent service. Even if the line seems long, you will have your pop in minutes. One of my favorite perks are the insulated take-away bags they give you for free if you want to take a pop(s) home! It will keep your pop frozen for up to a couple hours, per my experience. Lavender Lemonade if the definition of refreshing"
399,10/5/2016,Chrys P.,louisville-3,5,"This place is SWEET!  Amazing flavors, great ingredients, a definite recommend!  Try the pumpkin, it's delightful."
400,8/1/2016,Leah B.,louisville-3,5,This is the second type of popsicle place I've been to. What sets Steel City Pops apart is that you can see the popsicles as they're being made-which helped entertain the two little girls I was babysitting at the time. It's located around great local restaurants so it's the perfect place to POP into after dinner. Will definitely be going here again soon.
401,7/14/2016,Jan H.,louisville-3,5,This place lives up to the hype. Couldn't believe people were lining up out the door for popsicles until I tried one. Delicious. Can't wait to go back and try some more.
402,8/21/2016,Sara L.,louisville-3,5,"Yes, please!!!  My group had a cookies & Cream, Strawberry Lemonade, Horchata.  All wonderful.  Great flavors, great choices, and super helpful staff!  Definite repeat."
403,7/10/2016,Barry A.,louisville-3,5,Refreshing all natural frozen treat.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  Must stop if in the Highlands!
404,8/24/2016,Matthew C.,louisville-3,5,Went on a really hot day not knowing what to expect and had a great time. $3 seemed high but the random flavors and quality made me want to come back. I had the coffee one and I was more than satisfied. Can't wait to go back and try more.
405,6/11/2016,Robin H.,louisville-3,5,"I only write reviews for places I love. I stopped writing negative reviews because they are boring and whiny. I loved my Popsicle here! Then I ate the other one I bought to give a friend. I loved it, too! The chai latte surprised me the most, it was delicious. This is the perfect summer stop on bardstown rd. No ice-cream guilt for me."
406,7/29/2016,Doug M.,louisville-3,5,"This place made me pop! I made my first order there last Sunday, and that thing was easy like Sunday morning... My friend, Lionel, knows what I'm talking about!  Anyhoo, I had the onion bagel with cream cheese Popsicle, which was special and had a lingering, unique aftertaste. I took my time, however, and licked that thing up and down in a slow, deliberate manner, giggling loudly all the while. You should too!"
407,7/1/2016,Terry L.,louisville-3,1,"Got the blackberry and it was filled with seeds. More seeds than popsicle, #1 rule of making anything with blackberries is removing the seeds! WTF???"
408,6/5/2016,Zalt Ann Pepper P.,louisville-3,5,Friendly staff & a great variety of flavors.  I had the strawberry balsamic vinegar popsicle and it was amazing
409,6/5/2016,Joey W.,louisville-3,5,"A popsicle only shop? Only in the Highlands! Only in Louisville! Don't be scared off by the long line out front. They move pretty fast! My wife is in love with the lavender lemonade pop. I have tried the watermelon, blueberry basil and pin colada. All the winners! This is the perfect place to stop after dinner."
410,7/29/2016,Jamie R.,louisville-3,5,Perfect place for a summer day. I love the vanilla one with the choc chip cookie inside!
411,8/10/2016,Ali A.,louisville-3,5,"Lots of delicious and unique flavors! I also love the atmosphere here...BUT if you must go, they have awesome to-go pouches that keep your pop cold!"
412,8/10/2016,Nicole W.,louisville-3,4,A friend of mine took me to Steel City Pops to try out on 4th of July. I tried the watermelon. It was so good!! I will be back and have been recommending to friends.
413,8/7/2016,Annie M.,louisville-3,4,"I stopped in on Sunday afternoon on the recommendation of a Louisville friend. She and I giggled as we wondered how a place that sold only Popsicles could exist and stay open... But it's clear to me now how this place is successful. When we walked in, the store was busy, but the line was short. The worker behind the counter offered to help and made suggestions as we contemplated between fruity versus creamy options. Ultimately my fellow Popsicle tester opted for the strawberry lemonade (fruity) and I opted for the coffee (creamy). As a health-conscious dessert-enjoyer, I so appreciated that the menu included calories! The creamy Popsicles hover around 300 calories and the fruity ones range from around 90 to the hundreds. As far as flavor is concerned, we agreed the Popsicles were on point. My coffee one tasted like an iced illy caffe drink, and my friend said his was the perfect balance of strawberry and lemon.My only *tiny* complaint is that the guy behind the counter talked to me like I was a child, addressing my male friend first and calling me ""sweetie."" I am from Louisville and know basically everyone gets called sweetie, but I would recommend avoiding it as my friend and I agreed it came off a little sexist. Overall, however, an excellent (drippy- these melted fast in the sun!) dessert experience."
414,4/1/2016,Suzanne S.,louisville-3,5,Such a fun place. Love the flavors and freshness. 3rd time here. They've been open a week.
415,5/23/2016,Jeffrey B.,louisville-3,5,Service was quick and friendly. They have a variety of flavors on the menu. They have a number of fruit based pops that are very low calorie treats.
416,7/1/2016,Kristina L.,louisville-3,4,"I went for the first time today, tried the amaretto cream popsicle. It was delicious. I'll definitely return. The atmosphere was inviting and family friendly."
417,7/19/2016,Robert M.,louisville-3,4,I just had granite installed in my kitchen with DFW Stoneworks and I could not be happier.  They were the first to get Mubasa Black and I had to have it.  Staff was very helpful and friendly.  Was here on time and was out in less than a day.
418,4/2/2016,Megha M.,louisville-3,5,How can you go wrong with with pops !! The mango pop was excellent and the staff was super friendly !

Updated review",Jen S.,louisville-3,5,"Update - still five stars, but I just had the avocado Popsicle and it was out of this world. TRY IT"
420,7/8/2016,Kylyn S.,louisville-3,4,"The place is hip, they have great options, the price comes because the ingredients are great. well worth it"
421,6/13/2016,Steve D.,louisville-3,5,"Ok, I know what your thinking, "" $3.00 popsicle, get the &%$# outta here!"" I too was once a non-believer, a regular old popsicle infidel, but after being convinced by the two women who run my life ( 10 and 12 year old daughters) I tried this place. I've been back about twice a week since that cursed day. Pretty sure they could give you the first one for free and you know the rest..... Go here, eat a three dollar popsicle, you'll be glad you did."
422,4/19/2016,Lindsey C.,louisville-3,5,"This place is amazing! Perfect for the warmer weather, but I could probably eat their Popsicle's in the cold. I've had chocolate brownie, coffee, blueberry cream, pineapple jalapeño and sweet tea. Every flavor I've had is amazing. I can't wait to try all the flavors."
423,7/1/2016,Lorena G.,louisville-3,5,"Inspired by Mexican paletas, these are all-natural organic ice pops. Deliciously refreshing! Bet you will not find a pop you wont like!"
424,6/1/2016,Karen W.,louisville-3,4,Popsicles are $3 which can be sort of pricy but very good. We took a group of people here around 3pm on a Thursday and was not surprised it was already crowded. I wish the place had more space to sit down but other than that it was very clean!
425,12/5/2016,Stef R.,louisville-3,4,Pretty neat spot to take your family in the summer.
426,6/6/2016,Sean H.,louisville-3,5,Super friendly people here. Great assortment of pops. I got the sweet tea and it was awesome. Wish I would have bought more!
427,6/1/2016,Jan T.,louisville-3,5,"Who would've thought Popsicles could be so good?? They have an ever-changing menu of flavors consisting of fruity & creamy categories. I've tried the creamy ones but they taste like they're 60% cream with only a hint of whatever flavor you order(blueberry etc). Not my thing. The fruity ones, however, are on point :) full of flavor and with such a creative mix you'll never get bored- pineapple jalapeño, pomegranate, lavender lemonade...all delicious!"
428,5/28/2016,Sara F.,louisville-3,5,The Popsicles were delicious!! What a great idea! I love the concept and the bags for to-go are awesome and make it super convenient! We will definitely be back!!
429,5/13/2016,Allie R.,louisville-3,5,"If 10 stars was an option I would definitely give it 10 stars. Get price, get flavors. Everything that Louisville needs. Steel City is in a great location. All of the popsicles I have tried were delicious except for pineapple jalapeño and lavender lemonade but that's my own personal taste preference. All of the fruity are so refreshing and the creamy are like a real dessert. I've already been at least 10 times."
430,4/20/2016,Janell M.,louisville-3,5,"Love love love! This is a great place for parents to bring kids. There are large windows to watch the Popsicles being made and lots of open space to run. There are 24 flavors right now including avocado, brownie, sweet tea, strawberry lemonade etc. they also have more traditional flavors. The Popsicles are $3-4 a piece or a box of 4 for $11. I will be back again and again."
431,4/24/2016,Paige S.,louisville-3,5,"Such a cute spot, and very convenient to so many places on the strip of Bardstown road! We live close and will definitely be coming back for some summer treats! I got the blueberry cream and MAN was it delicious! Lots of options and very friendly staff."
432,4/18/2016,Melodie U.,louisville-3,5,"First time going today, and it was a huge success! Very pleased with the variety and impressed with the organic ingredients!

433,4/15/2016,Blair K.,louisville-3,5,Such a refreshing alternative to ice cream or yogurt! The pineapple jalapeno pop was everything I never knew I wanted. Can't wait to go back!
434,8/19/2016,Stephanie S.,louisville-3,5,"This is one of my new favorite places! The Popsicles are delicious and reasonably priced. Each time I've been there it has been busy, but the service has been quick. The Bardstown Road location gives it a great atmosphere."
435,4/6/2016,Shaun T.,louisville-3,5,They're popsicle are very good and it's vegan non daily product believe me the owner and employees are very nice $3 of pops it's not asking too much it's good
436,9/9/2016,Shannon M.,louisville-3,5,"Sooooo good. I seriously wish I would have brought this concept to town, but the smart folks at Steel City Pops beat me to it. The flavors are incredible...how they pack so much punch into one bar is beyond me. And the prices are decent, considering you're getting a locally made popsicle made from fresh ingredients. Get a case and pop them in your freezer."
437,8/13/2016,Kelly L.,louisville-3,4,"Pretty good! They were busy but had a short line. Staff was extremely helpful, but my coconut popsicle was just average. Something I could've gotten from the store for less than $3. Cool atmosphere, though."
438,3/26/2016,Dalton C.,louisville-3,5,Love this cute little shop! First off tax is included in the price which I love! Lots of different options from traditional to more odd flavors (avocado)!!! And $3-$5 for dessert is pretty much a steal now days!!! Excited to try more flavors as it continues to warm up!
439,7/11/2016,Janice F.,louisville-3,4,"Oh, the choices you have to make, so many wonderful flavors.  It's cool, refreshing, and fun to eat. Like a grown up dessert  on a stick that makes you feel young again.  Go for it...."
440,6/13/2016,Darby S.,louisville-3,5,"Took the family, everyone loved it.  Something different and cool on a hot summer day.  The sour cherry was good, but not really that sour.  My kids loved the vanilla and the pina colada."
441,6/3/2016,Robin W.,louisville-3,5,"It was a great place for a quick cool down. Lots of popsicle variety in the store, including things for vegans."
442,7/27/2016,Sarah N.,louisville-3,4,so many delicious choices!  my favorites so far have been the jasmine green tea and the buttermilk.  my only complaint is the positioning of counter/door/line.  there are so many fans of this great spot that the line becomes pretty long.  its not immediately clear how many lines there are at any given time and there's really no good way for the line to form without blocking the limited seats available and the entrance.
443,8/15/2017,Kelly P.,lexington,5,"Steel City Pops is awesome! We've loved them since they opened their doors in Louisville. So, when I heard they moved into the Summit in Lexington I was totally down to stop in. I've since been to this location twice, and both stops were great. The line has been long both times, as it often is at the Louisville location; however, they move really quickly, so the wait has never been too long. The flavors are all great and I've never tried one I haven't enjoyed. I highly recommend Steel City Pops!"
444,8/13/2017,Rick G.,lexington,5,"Who would've thought a popsicle joint would be a thing! But these aren't just any popsicles! There are unique flavors closer to texture of popsicles and there are others closer to ice cream pops. Being a chilihead, I went for the spiciest thing on the menu which was Pineapple Jalapeño. That might sound gross for a popsicle but the sweet and spicy combo was actually quite delightful.You can also order them by the boxes. While a great summer idea, I think this treat will be great anytime you're looking for a different treat!"
445,7/29/2017,Niki V.,lexington,5,"Yasssss to this soooo much. We got four, oatmeal cream pie, passion fruit, vanilla chocolate chip, and passion fruit. I had to try all of ours but might have been a bit stingy with sharing mine. I had the oatmeal cream pie, the taste was great- I only wish the cookie pieces were spread out instead of just clumped in the middle. But if that's my only ""complaint"" it's really not even a complaint, just a suggestion. I would get it again for sure. The strawberry lemonade was probably the best out of the four we tried. My son loved it, he won't try anther. Please don't stop this flavor The passion fruit was a bit too sour but my husband enjoyed it. My youngest son enjoyed the vanilla chocolate chip (as did I) but didn't care for the cookie part when it got to the cookie. He enjoyed all parts of it.Oh and these bars are huge!!! We didn't do the extra drizzles and such, but have that on the radar for the next time. I love that they have rewards too.  GO GET A POPSICLE ALREADY!!!!Update: We've been 3 times this weekend. We've also tried Peanut Butter Pie, cookies and cream, and Avocado. Avocado is my favorite now, dipped in white chocolate and covered in pistachios. If you like avocado like a true millennial, eat it!!!! But dip it for sure."
446,9/22/2017,Shannon D.,lexington,5,"Tonite was our first visit, and when we saw the line, we really asked ourselves if any popsicle could be worth waiting in a line THAT long.    Well, these ones certainly are.   They offer a wide array of fruit pops ranging from something as simple as peach to something more daring like pineapple jalapeño.  On the creamy side, you also have lots of options.  My daughter tried the chocolate pop, and I tried the special - a salted caramel cheesecake pop.   Both were fantastic, and we cannot wait to go back and try a fruit pop.   And when all is said and done, we were quite impressed with how quickly the line moved, so don't let that deter you."
447,10/1/2017,Elaine D.,lexington,4,"A perfect day for an icy treat.  What to choose?  I'm a purist when it comes to ice cream.  I don't necessarily want add-ons.  I spied the pineapple jalapeno pop, which intrigued.  Anything with jalapeno is good with me.  Since this flavor is going away, I had to try it now.  Very refreshing.  Loved the bits of jalapeno, and the heat they brought gave the pop a pop.  Many more unique flavors to try -- and I will."
448,7/15/2017,Kaylyn E.,lexington,4,"I was a little skeptical of Steel City Pops at first. I mean only serving popsicles? However, I have returned already three times. Any time I am in the Summit I can't seem not to stop by and get a pop! I have tried the cookies and cream, brownie, watermelon, and strawberry lemonade. So far my favorite is the strawberry lemonade, however, if you are in the creamy pop mood go with the cookie dough! It is like a frozen cookie inside of creamy ice cream.For a little extra you can get it dipped, dusted, or drizzled with other toppings! Pops range in price, but typically average 3 to 4 dollars a pop. So it can add up if you get several. I think of it like getting an ice cream cone or blizzards at other places (its a dessert or specialty dessert). Plus their ingredients are all natural so you know what your are eating and that always is worth the extra to me. My husband and I can split one and it is usually the perfect amount of sweet after dinner.Also be sure to sign up for their rewards by just giving them your number. In no time at all you could get a free popsicle. My only concern with Steel City Pops is their seating. Their seating is very limited and bar style (meaning you sit side by side and face outside the window.) This could be tricky with large groups and/or in the colder months!"
449,9/17/2017,Emily B.,lexington,4,"I love the location (The Summit is quickly becoming one of my favorite Lexington areas), and the popsicles here are very good!  Prices are a bit high (especially if you want any sort of topping), and I'd love to see more creative flavors, but definitely worth a stop on a hot day."
450,6/5/2017,Rob B.,lexington,4,"Steel City Pops has now opened a location in Lexington at The Summit at Fritz Farm. Steel CIty Pops offers gourmet popsicles---and they are delicious. Price per popsicle begins at $3. You can also have your choice of flavors dipped or dusted and topped with various toppings, which costs a bit more.Steel City Pops are based on unique sweets which the founder discovered several years ago at a similar established serving pops called Mexican paletas--more commonly known as pops. According to Steel City Pop's founder, ""These delicious paletas were gourmet, brightly colored, all natural, and healthy, too--simply unlike anything we'd ever had. When we tasted these amazing pops, we decided everyone needed to know about this.""Fast-forward a few years and Steel City Pops was founded. I had tried them in Louisville about a year ago and have eagerly anticipated their opening at The Summit here in Lexington. Open only a few days they are already doing a very steady business and kids and adults alike look very happy seated inside and outside the store. The servers behind the counter were very fast and happy to explain the various options and available flavors. You can also buy them by the dozen or even in larger quantities. I sampled two separate pops on my visit. The coconut was terrific. So good in fact, I decided to try a second flavor: Vanilla Bean dipped in dark chocolate sprinkled with graham cracker crumbles. Also very good. There are various dips and ways to ""dust"" your pop. There are also fruity flavor choices and available flavors change based on various items in season. Steeel City Pops is a welcome addition to Lexington's food scene and as summer arrives, you just might have to wait in line. But they are worth the wait."
451,9/12/2017,Carlos H.,lexington,4,"While I've given up dairy for the most part, I must admit that I'm a fan of this place. I've been multiple times, and I've found the staff to be very friendly and the prices very reasonable. I've tried the chocolate brownie and oatmeal cream pie cookie pops, and both of them are so amazing that even typing about them is making my mouth water right now. Be warned, though, these pops will start to melt on you when you're about halfway through them. So keep some napkins nearby!"
452,7/8/2017,Christina C.,lexington,5,"This place is amazing. I feel like I never run into artisan popsicle shops so I was pleasantly surprised when my friend and I saw so many people at Summit having a popsicle.I decided to get the avocado popsicle. It was fantastic. I loved it so much. It had some lime in it too. It really tasted like mostly avocado, instead of having lots of ice. It is a quality popsicle.There are adirondack chairs outside to sit on, which is great on a sunny day!"
453,9/28/2017,Ranada W.,lexington,4,Loved the pops we got - family of 3 for just under $20 is a bit steep in my opinion - but I'll be back. They were good - the long line let's you know it's a hit.
454,7/18/2017,Stephanie C.,lexington,4,"What a fun new place in the Summit - a perfect destination on a hot day. There were lots of unique flavors, some fruity and some rich and decadent. After much deliberation I chose the Lavender Lemonade since it was the first to catch my eye, and my husband chose the Oatmeal Creme Pie. My choice was perfect for the 90+ degree day, as it was very refreshing. My husband liked his, but regretted not getting a fruit flavor that would have been more refreshing than filling. The shop itself is a bit small, and can be a little difficult to navigate (if you have not been there before) if it is busy, as there is no clear indication of where you order and where you pay. There is limited seating inside, which may present issues during cold weather, but there is also outdoor seating available to enjoy your popsicle on a warm day. Don't forget to grab some napkins! In addition to the fun flavors available, you can choose to have your popsicle dusted, dipped or drizzled in a variety of ways. This, of course, costs extra, and our popsicles were $3.25 each with no additions, which I thought was a little expensive (only reason I did not go with a 5 star rating). They do offer a loyalty program, with which you earn a free popsicle after you purchase ten. Despite the price, I cannot wait to return and try more of the flavors!"
455,6/10/2017,Teresa M.,lexington,4,"Fantastic pops, but definitely not inexpensive - we got two regular pops (strawberry lemonade and oatmeal cream pie) and one dipped pop (strawberry cream dipped in chocolate) and it came in around $11. Employees were very friendly, but the line was disorganized - could use some more direction on how to order/pay. Also could use more seating in the shade. We will definitely be back!"
456,7/8/2017,Kathryn P.,lexington,5,"Steel City Pops is a great place to go. It is is the new Summit shopping area so it great place to grab a popsicle and sit around the beautiful new area. The only problem is you can't bring in the popsicle to most of the shops, so buy it as one of you last stops.The popsicles are pretty drippy so grab a couple napkins.  They have cornhole set up right outside and a fountain right around the back. Super pretty and super tasty. It goes around $3 to $6 depending on the toppings you get."
457,8/14/2017,Angela M.,lexington,4,"These are really good, but not sure they are worth waiting in a long line. I like how you can get something light a fruity, but then add a drizzle of chocolate if you want."
458,7/26/2017,Aviva C.,lexington,5,"Absolutely delicious popsicles at a reasonable price. Very convenient setting at the center of The Summit. Fun place to hang out, too. I had coconut and look forward to trying every flavor."
459,8/12/2017,Jennifer B.,lexington,5,"Caroline was so helpful in suggesting an amazingly delicious pop that she dipped, drenched and drizzled for me. Suggest the peanut butter dipped in dark chocolate-this is better than a Reese."
460,7/28/2017,McCall D.,lexington,4,"Yum! Fun, different and refreshing. You can pick from a variety of pops, some being fruit based and other cream or cookie bases. Their menu also not only shows the calories per pop, but has a pop for everyone and their dietary needs. Once you choose your pop, you can keep it plain and simple or dip, drizzle, dredge AND/OR dust it. Countless combinations to try!"
461,8/14/2017,Chrissy L.,lexington,4,"This is a really cool concept to have flavored, fresh popsicles with a variety of toppings available. I had the peaches and cream and watermelon ones and they were definitely delicious. You can add some toppings, like salt on watermelon, for free but dipping in chocolate and such cost an extra dollar. I like how they also give you little containers to put your popsicl in for the drips, that even has a little indentation for the popsicle stick! This is a great dessert place for the summer, but slightly expensive for a popsicle to go regularly. Will definitely be back to try more flavors!"
462,7/15/2017,Heather M.,lexington,5,"So good! Had the Oat Meal Creme Pie Pop, tasted just like the Little Debbie creme pie but popsicle style! Bonus - you can dust, dip, drizzle your pop in a variety of ways! There was line out the door but goes quick so don't let that stop you from going. They range $3 to $4 and extras are are $1.  They also have a loyalty card."
463,7/14/2017,Timothy F.,lexington,5,"If you are looking for a quick treat, but don't want the 500 Calories of an ice cream cone, I definitely recommend steel city pops. In the new Fritz Farm shopping complex, they offer classic fruity pops, creamy pops, and cookie pops. And don't think you're going to get the generic grape, lemon, cherry flavors. Make sure you branch out and try the blueberry basil or pineapple jalapeño. Coupled with a great sitting area right outside, it makes for a great family friendly way to close out a summer evening."
464,7/31/2017,Shelby R.,lexington,5,This place is amazing! I'm definitely coming back. I got the watermelon and it tasted just like it. It was sweet too! My boyfriend went with me and he got the peanut butter pie. He liked it a lot and he doesn't even like popsicles. His even had cookie in it. These are the best popsicles I have ever had!
465,6/16/2017,Tonya M.,lexington,4,The watermelon pop is amazing! Tastes just like a frozen slice of watermelon on a stick. My kids got strawberry lemonade & root beer. Strawberry lemonade was good though not as good as mine and the root beer was very sweet and mostly tasted like sugar according to my son. At $3 and up a pop I think they should offer a sample before you purchase. Maybe a small frozen piece? The cream pops looked good and I am looking forward to trying the coconut pop next. Overall a great treat yourself spot!
466,7/20/2017,Sara H.,lexington,5,"Wow! We were blown away by how good these were! We went to the area for a little Anniversary lunch date and stumbled upon Steel City Pops. I had the cucumber lime (it was delicious!!) and my husband has the blueberry basil, also a great choice! We have a feeling that all of them are just as good as the ones we had today so we will definitely be back to try more!"
467,6/28/2017,Emily M.,lexington,4,"I should start out by saying I am partial to the Summit, not because it's new but it's my kind of scene! Steel City Pops is located in the center area, a cute little greenery place that has a fire pit and Adirondack chairs. You have the choice between a cream base which is like a normal popsicle with a ton of amazing flavors (get the coffee), then they have a regular consistency popsicle. The regular popsicles are mostly fruit flavors, so perfect when it's a million degrees outside. I had the grueling decision between passion fruit or basil watermelon. Basil watermelon was the pop of choice. They are super cheap ($3) and very tasty! You can totally tell it's fresh flavors and not too sweet. I had the anticipation for my pop to be really sweet, like most watermelon flavors, I was wrong they really like to use the flavors of the natural fruit and herb to enhance the taste. I recommend this place for any and all events"
468,8/8/2017,Bill B.,lexington,5,Delicious product with many choices of flavors for their pops. Excellent location if the parking lot isn't too busy.  I would recommend going later at night. Staff is very friendly and professional but their product is expensive.
469,7/6/2017,Beth P.,lexington,5,"Very good! Taste like fresh fruit, great flavors. Haven't had any toppings because the pops are good enough."
470,6/14/2017,Michele V.,lexington,4,Great popsicles. Lots of flavors. I had the rootbeer and my friend had the cucumber lime with a dusting of salt. Delicious! Great idea.  Not much seating. If too hot or cold no where sit.
471,10/3/2017,Frances A.,dallas-2,5,"Me: ""how many stars would you give this place?""Friend that brought me: ""6.""Me: ""but Yelp only has 5 stars.""Friend: ""yes. 6 out of 5.""This place is delectable! Lots of options, flavors frequently updated. I loved the rosemary/plum. You can dip your popsicle in different chocolates + toppings. Excellent flavor- can a popsicle be gourmet???? These sure were."
472,10/1/2017,Ali B.,dallas-2,5,I went last night after truck yard with my sister and her kids. They have benches outside to enjoy your pop's. I couldn't decide on 2 flavors and they offered an awesome cold pack take away so I could enjoy one later. I did decline because I'm not that into sweets. I ordered the raspberry lemon after the cashier suggested against it when I asked. Why did I ask and not take the suggestion is beyond me! It was super tart. Which honestly I typically like but if you are wanting to be able to complete your popsicle maybe not choose this one. My niece polished it off no problem. Everyone else loved their pops. The creamy ones seemed to be the favorites. My date got something like.. cookies and cream. I tried to ste[e]l it. Pun intended. I'll take the suggestion next time. Service was good. There are benches outside to enjoy your popsicle and their gift cards are super cute!
473,9/16/2017,Annie F.,dallas-2,5,"Cheap. Healthy. I've never had a bad popsicle from them (granted, I've never had their creamy popsicles).Flavors I've tried:*Lemon - really tart, you'll love it if you like tart things*Peach - tastes like you're biting in a real peach!*Lavender lemonade - you can actually have the aftertaste of lavender, not as vibrant in color as the other popsicles if you're looking for that instagram picture*Avocado - frequently sells out, people rave about itTip: sign up for their reward program!"
474,8/17/2017,Kimberly J.,dallas-2,4,"Excellent pops!I'm a huge fan of Las Paletas in Nashville and so when we saw Steel City Pops in Dallas, we definitely wanted to check this place out. Parking around here can be a bit difficult to find. There is some street parking. Indoor and outdoor seating is available. Employees are super sweet and helpful. Pops are each $3 but if you get 4 pops it's $11 and you get a bag that keeps your pops cool till you get home. Their pops were packed with flavor and quality ingredients are used. They were super refreshing on a hot day.If you're looking for a cool treat that is sure to make your tastebuds happy, Steel City Pops is your place."
475,8/15/2017,Salena C.,dallas-2,3,"Popsicles are the perfect treat for a hot day, but I think we missed the appeal here. I ordered a Lemon Lavender popsicle out of the fruit section (think water-based instead of cream-based), and I was disappointed to find absolutely no Lavender taste whatsoever! Don't get me wrong, it was a great lemon popsicle for sure, but don't label it something it's not! BF ordered a pineapple jalapeño, and thought there was way too much kick for it to be enjoyable (probably because they let it ripen all the way until it turned red, as seen by the red specks in the popsicles). I probably wouldn't return because they aren't true to their flavor profiles, but if you're going for a basic flavor, it's worth a $3 treat."
476,8/8/2017,Sam G.,dallas-2,5,"Tried Steel City Pops while in Birmingham for work and have been a fan ever since!I am a fan of the fruit based pops and went with a Strawberry Lemonade and my girlfriend got the cookie dough, dipped in chocolate. Both pops were excellent and service was friendly and fast. I will definitely be back."
477,9/12/2017,Joey L.,dallas-2,4,"Amazing pops for a sweltering day. I'm usually a creamy dessert kind of person, but my appetite was wiped so I opted for a fruity pop. My companions also chose something fruity and we were all delighted with our choice. I got the lavender lemonade. The lemonade became overwhelming after a few bites and the lavender got lost, but it was a delicious choice regardless. There was definitely a line of constant patrons when we went in the afternoon so be prepared. Also, it's a pretty small space so be prepared to eat your pop outside."
478,9/1/2017,Sarah A.,dallas-2,5,"This was my second time enjoying Steel City Pops, but my first at this location (I had previously had them at their cart in Klyde Warren Park). The parking in this area on a Friday night is hectic, so my husband dropped me off in front while he drove around the block.As I walked up I noticed cameras everywhere. The lady that was being filmed out front asked if I was there for dessert. I informed her I was, and she said that the North Texas Honda Dealership would be treating me to a popsicle as she handed me a coupon card. I thanked her and made my way inside to even more cameras and representatives from Honda. The cameras were a little overwhelming as they filmed me ordering and speaking with the employees, but I was grateful that they were treating me to dessert.The ladies working at Steel City Pops were very helpful in recommending flavors. I personally prefer the creamy pops to the fruity ones, so I took their recommendations of the Strawberries and Creme and the Coffee flavored popsicles. We were not disappointed! My husband loved the Strawberries and Creme, and the Coffee pop reminded me of Starbucks flavored ice cream. Delicious! Steel City Pops is a great choice on a warm summer night!"
479,8/16/2017,Alexandra G.,dallas-2,4,I love this little shop - super cute and good popsicles! A nice little walk for a sweet treat after dinner on Greenville. It's always packed but the line goes quick so don't let that dissuade you from stopping in.I'd recommend their oatmeal cookie dipped in milk chocolate - delicious!My only complaint is that the outside and entryway smell like sour dairy. It's unfortunate especially if you want to sit outside. Maybe a good scrub is all it needs?
480,6/26/2017,Rucha M.,dallas-2,4,"Drove by this place when we were dining in lower Greenville and decided to keep some room for a visit. Very much like an ice cream parlor but for popsicles. They have 3 kinds with fruit based, cream based, and cookie based. The interesting thing is that they have the calorie count which was nice. Given it was my first time I asked for some recommendations and the servers were very happy. They suggested the raspberry lemonade over the lavender lemonade. Will have to come back to try the creamy and cookie based ones. The raspberry lemonade was very fresh and light and tasty. It did have a lot of raspberry seeds which I wasn't expecting. Overall very tasty dessert spot especially if your in the lower Greenville area. Not sure if I would make a trip out of going. If they have a food truck I would look out for it. Perfect for a hot summer night!I think during the day you could probably see them making the popsicles. They have a small indoor and outdoor space to sit."
481,8/18/2017,Jen D.,dallas-2,5,"Gotta thank my Dallas friend for bringing me here on my visit! The popsicles were soooooo good. It's ridiculous how delicious a well-made popsicle can be but Steel City Pops has got the recipe down. The store itself is smaller with some counter seating inside but a lot of people just grabbed there's to eat on the go. The staff was friendly and super helpful in describing the various flavors. The Strawberry lemonade was the best; nice and refreshing on a hot Texas day. I sat inside and ate my $3 popsicle and thought this place must make some killer margins on these sales. The cream popsicles, that come with cookies inside of them, were like $4.50. Kudos to the business geniuses behind Steel City Pops. I'll definitely make an effort to stop by when I'm back in Dallas! Maybe there should be a store in Chicago?"
482,6/3/2017,Randi B.,dallas-2,4,"If you have a sweet tooth, go ahead and call this place heaven. Steel City Pops on Greenville is one of my favorite dessert shops to visit. The place itself is pretty small and feels a little cramped when a big crowd comes to visit. Thankfully, there is some indoor seating and a beautiful patio to sit once you grab your pops!They have a wide variety of flavors ranging from your typical fruit flavors like strawberry and pineapple, all the way to chai tea and buttermilk. They recently adding toppings and dips to their menu selection and I'm a big fan. Try dipping your pops in their tasty chocolate syrup or my favorite, white chocolate! Eat on y'all!"
483,4/9/2017,Arun P.,dallas-2,4,Some really funky flavors for pops! Tried the Pineapple Jalapeño and Coconut in the store and decided to take a few others to go. The pops are definitely addictive and you want to try more.Price : $3 for a pop is for sure on the higher side but keep in mind these are not the regular store popsicles. You do pay the price for the new and cool flavors. The steep price is the only reason for the 4 stars.Walking down Greenville you will see almost everyone enjoying a pop :)The to-go bags are awesome and they add an ice brick to keep the pops frozen till you reach home.
484,4/11/2017,Ananya K.,dallas-2,4,"Cute place in Lower Greenville with various popsicle flavors. You can go with fruity, creamy or ice cream. I went with the chocolate brownie popsicle and had it dipped in white chocolate. I thought it was delicious. Also got vanilla dipped in chocolate with caramel drizzle which reminded me of the Haagen Daz ice cream. I'm not big into fruity flavors but my other two friends got passionfruit and lime and liked it as well. The lime was more creamy than the fruity flavors. If I was in the area I'd drop by again for the chocolate brownie popsicle but otherwise wouldn't go out of my way to come here. It's a cool concept but I'm not a popsicle person"
485,4/13/2017,Danielle C.,dallas-2,5,"Cute little ice cream store located on Greenville Avenue (and several more locations around DFW area)! They have about 20 different ""pop's"" you can choose from ranging from $3-$5 dollars. Fruit and sweet flavors for every type of person! Service is great and quick.Make sure to eat your pop quickly because they melt fast! Watch out for the summer heat because they melt fast."
486,8/15/2017,Renee' V.,dallas-2,5,My boyfriend and I stumbled upon Steel City Pops as we were exploring Dallas. It's a cute little spot. I love how there is an open area and window in which you can see the process of how the pops are made. I ordered the Chocolate Brownie cookie pop and it was so good! Very cooling especially on a 99 degree day!
487,8/1/2017,Cameron W.,dallas-2,5,This is my new favorite spot. I just call it Steel City.  I have been twice. I have yet to try any of the creamy pops or the cookie pops but the fruity pops have gotten the job done so far.  The first time I went I got the passion fruit pop. It was exceptional. And by exceptional I mean I was hooked.  It tasted that much better because it was exactly how I imagined it was going to taste.  Wasn't overly fake sweet and not too bland either. It was right and refreshing. The second I went I got the lavender lemonade and because it was broiling hot and lemonade sounding like the smart thing to get along with something that I'm familiar with when I make ice cream which is lavender. I was a little disappointed because I thought the lavender would have played more of a star in the flavor profile. But all in all it was refreshing.
488,6/2/2017,Rini S.,dallas-2,4,"So many flavors!! Love how many options there are here. The pricing is pretty reasonable as well. It's a cute place to come with your friends, your boyfriend, your children... whoever! The workers are very sweet and try to help you find your favorite flavor. It's definitely a place to come again and again. I recommend trying the strawberry lemonade!"
489,4/17/2017,Jessica H.,dallas-2,5,"Steel City done changed my life. Hit this joint up for the first time on a Friday evening out with my mom. Childhood flashbacks of Fla-Vor-Ice® fruity pops had me feeling jaded dropping $7.50 on two pops but that feeling vanished just as soon as that heavenly flavor graced my tongue. I had the Passion Fruit and my mom the Chocolate Brownie which contained a chunky chocolate brownie in its center (let's all just take a moment). The pop was chilled to perfection and I was successfully able to slowly savor this treat for over twenty minutes without experiencing an epic meltdown in 80 degree weather.The location is small so it's an order & jet situation, but ample seating outside proved to be accommodating. If you get a chance when ordering check out the magnificent skyline mural donning their wall.Adequate pricing, fast/friendly service, and quality mind-blowing flavors are sure to steel your heart as it did mine."
490,9/12/2017,Ray G.,dallas-2,5,Good ice cream pop very friendly people with fast service. It was so nice sitting outside enjoying our desert with family. Cool  spot
491,7/25/2017,Sunny L.,dallas-2,2,"It's my first time in Dallas, and I wanted something light and sweet after dinner. Steel City Pops came up on Yelp with raving reviews, so off I went. I actually don't think $3 is unreasonably expensive for a popsicle, so I went ahead and bought two (both for myself!).I love avocado and avocado-based desserts, so that was an easy choice. I picked watermelon for the second one, so that I could try one ""creamy"" and one ""fruity"" pop. The line moved quickly at 9pm on a Tuesday night, so I was in and out in a few minutes.I tried the avocado pop first. It was so sweet! It was not creamy as I had expected, and I could barely even taste any avocado flavor. I ate 1/3 and threw the rest away. I opened my watermelon pop, thinking: watermelon is already delicious on it's own, how bad could it be? The watermelon was even sweeter than the avocado. I ate three bites and threw that out too.As I said earlier, I don't think $3 is too expensive for a popsicle. But I just spent $6 for two sickenly sweet popsicles that I ended up throwing away. I don't get the hype. That's okay though. I'm one less person you'll have to wait behind in line."
492,7/30/2017,Lauren N.,dallas-2,5,"If I could give this place 6 stars, I would. You pick a pop- creamy or fruity ( Vegan options), then you can dip it, dredge it, drizzle it, and dust if you want.  They also do specialty pops throughout the year such as - my favorite - peanut butter pie ( a creamy vanilla pop with a rich peanut butter cookie on the inside). You cannot fail with this place."
493,4/14/2017,Wilbur V.,dallas-2,5,"Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!They have an awesome assortment of Ice Cream Pops and/or Fruit Pops. The concept is pretty ingenious in my perspective. You go up to the counter, look at the menu, select the pop, pay, and then they open the wrapper for you and you're well on your way!What gets me coming back is really me wanting to try every flavor. If you don't like a flavor, they'd gladly replace it for free! I must say, this place must make a profit because it really is so cheap to make these from what I'm thinking.All in all, 5-star place and I will always coming back whenever I'm in the area!"
494,10/11/2016,Emily H.,dallas-2,5,"This place was seriously delicious. We ran into their little popsicle cart at Klyde Warren Park and I was so excited by their offerings! Tons of variety- I couldn't wait to try them! I had the pumpkin and my friend had butter pecan. Both were super tasty! The pumpkin was creamy and delicious- it exceeded all my expectations. They charge $3 per pop, which seems fair, given what excellent quality the popsicles were! Would definitely recommend to anyone seeking a yummy cold dessert in Dallas."
495,9/11/2016,Ai Vy N.,dallas-2,4,"Great popsicles: Check! Trendy and for the wannabe cool kids: Check! Expensive for being trendy: Check! Hard to resist if you're already in the area: Check!When I first heard of SCP, my curiosity led me here just to see what the hype is about this place. Now after several times of being here, I can finally come to a conclusion: they offer many great flavors and the pops are delicious, not only that, the customer service here are excellent. They hand you the popsicles after opening the bag for you. I know it sounds minimal, but it's a nice touch. Also, you can definitely get their popsicles to go and bring home for later. They offer dry ice in the bag or box, depends on how many popsicles you get. The popsicles are indeed a little pricey for $3-$3.5/ea. I don't make it a habit of stopping here all the time, but their coconut pops are too good to resist, especially on a hot day, walking around in the lower Greenville."
496,11/5/2016,Jess L.,dallas-2,5,"My friend brought me here during my visit to Dallas and she was raving about these pops! Steel city pops has a store front location in Dallas but we decided to grab a pop in the park right in uptown. They had a variety of flavors, but per the employees recommendation, I got strawberry lemonade. It was sour and sweet (but a little more sour than I would have liked it) but over all delicious!!! Each pop is $3 so not a bad price and especially worth it in the Dallas heat. The guy that sold us our pops was awesome as well. Swing by their store front if you have time, you won't regret it!"
497,4/16/2017,Andy C.,dallas-2,4,"Sure you can go to a grocery store and get a box of popsicles for the price of one Steel City Pop, but that is missing the point. SCP is a destination and a treat that you give yourself or someone else.  The popsicle experience is already fleeting and brief.  You can't slowly savor a popsicle (esp in the Dallas summer swelter) without it dripping down your hand and forearm.  Which is why a gourmet popsicle makes that much more sense.  SCP packs unique flavors and creamy goodness into the few short minutes it takes to finish one of their frozen treats. Pick between fresh fruit flavors made from fresh fruit and spices (honey dew, lime and pineapple jalapeño are some of my favs) or one of their creamy and more sinful options (coffee, coconut, peanut butter are all wonderful). All their products are made fresh with great ingredients. Service has always been great as well. During peak times expect long lines out the door but be patient. The queue moves quickly."
498,4/15/2017,Rumna C.,dallas-2,4,"Close to a great restaurant neighborhood, so a great dessert choice post dinner. And that's exactly what we did last night. This place is clearly quite popular and has a large variety of flavors, including some really unexpected ones like avocado and jalapeños. I chose honeydew - and actually felt I was biting into the cold fruit."
499,7/21/2017,Johnny B.,dallas-2,5,We came here after some dinner & drinks at HG and I ordered the avocado & chocolate brownie. I would not suggest the avocado unless you like key lime pie( that's what it taste like). The brownie was really good! Over all great place to chill down from the Texas weather. 7 bucks for 2 steel pops.
500,7/25/2017,Julie Z.,dallas-2,4,Popsicles r greattt! I didn't like pineapple jalapeño tho Bc that's just weird. It was like a ssweet and spicy popsicle. Blech. Our company brought it to work and I liked every other flavor tho! I really like strawberry lemonade and sweet tea.
501,1/19/2017,Kavya C.,dallas-2,4,"I love Steel City Pops! They have really great popsicles and all of the flavors are always interesting. I've only gotten the fruit ones once and was a tad bit disappointed because it just kind of tasted like orange juice but my mind completely changed when I started ordering the creamier popsicles! They're all so so yummy. My absolute favorite is the buttermilk popsicle, which reminds me of a sweet Indian lassi. The avocado and chocolate ones are amazing too. I'd love to go back and try other flavors but I'm always so partial to the buttermilk one that I never wanna try any of the other ones! Definitely go try it - I know it sounds a little weird but it's AMAZING. As for service and lines, the lines can get long sometimes but it usually goes by so fast that you're not actually waiting for a long period of time. The staff is friendly and quick!"
502,1/21/2017,Vic F.,dallas-2,5,"PERFECT FOR TEXAS SUN AND TEXAS SNOW.First and foremost, SHOUT OUT to the ladies who paid it forward to us and paid for our pops. Definitely made my first experience here more special. It was a rainy day in Dallas, a day that was flirting with the first snow of the season. As  my friend and I were searching for ice cream heaven on Greenville, we came across a small boutique shop covered with a wooden awning. There was something comforting about being outside in the cold, drizzling Texas weather and looking into a warm and cozy ice cream shop. But I am not here for something warm, I am looking for something that runs a sweet, refreshing chill down my spine. The Food: HANDHELD HAPPINESS ON A STICK.Buttermilk Ice Pop: AKA FROZEN NEW YORK CHEESECAKE ON A STICK.A Buttermilk Ice Pop sounds like ""that Southern treat"" that rednecks would go crazy for, and if so, this ice pop has awoken the inner redneck in me. Truly smooth, creamy, and free of the pesky grains of ice crystals that ruins the ice cream experience with the crunching and gnashing of teeth. Honestly, the taste resembles the tangy, creamy, cheesy flavor of cheesecake filling. These flavors work well with the smooth texture of the ice pop, which also gently melts on your tongue. Coffee Ice Pop: STARBUCKS OF THE FUTURE.Look...we are looking for the next big treat of our generation; the Acai bowl of 2017. Coffee medicates us on a daily basis, but people often forget how delicious, complex, and intricate it is. This Coffee Ice Pop is the perfect, frozen frappucchino laced with milky goodness. Intense coffee flavor that coats your mouth to indulgent goodness, but fades away so that you do not have coffee breath. Once again, the ice pop is smooth, creamy, and free of the pesky grains of ice crystals that require you to chew through the ice. The Verdict: STEEL CITY STILL POPPIN'Steel City Pops rotates their flavors with each season, so I had the spring flavors. They execute their Ice Pops very well, as they are creamy and without any ice crystals that can ruin the smooth, ice cream experience. Definitely come back and try their entire arsenal of ice pops. The Coffee Ice Pop is a tribute to all those that self-medicate with coffee, this treat is for YOU. The Buttermilk Ice Pop is for those that enjoy that cheesecake filling with less guilt and more refresh. Taking flavors from ordinary, everyday life and transforming them into ice cream pops is what Steel City Pops does. I will be back, whether during Texas heat, sleet, rain, or snow."
503,2/23/2017,Devon G.,dallas-2,4,"Time visited: Thur at 5 pm. It was not busy.I know, I could become excommunicado for this review...I'm not sure what the hype is about this place!I get they are natural and fresh products and yummy and  the holy popsicles of Greenville. I'm all for fresh and healthy. I love me some healthy eating and popsicles. In just not sure why Steel City Pops didn't blow my socks off. My flavor (Apple Cinnamon) was good. It tasted liked frozen Apple sauce. I could tell they use actual ingredients. Yay!I always see long lines but the shop is small so I can't see why the line is always out the door. The service was just Dandy. They were quick and kind.Summary: Good pops all year round."
504,5/11/2016,Kathy D.,dallas-2,5,"We first discovered Steel City Pops at 'til Midnight at the Nasher. They were selling pops there, and I refused to pay $3 for a popsicle. My boyfriend went to the ""restroom"" and came back with a watermelon and a cucumber lime. I wanted to be mad but ohhh myy!! I'm not a fan of cucumber but my boyfriend really liked his and I loved my watermelon one! They were so refreshing, and they tasted clean, rich, and natural. They don't really fall apart on you either. We were converts!We stopped by after having ramen, and I was REALLY looking forward to trying the strawberry cream pop. But of course, they're not available. It's such a bummer having your heart set on something only to be let down. ): They have rotating flavors so keep an open mind.We had strawberry and raspberry lemon this time. I liked the strawberry, but the raspberry lemon was gross to me. It was very seedy and bumpy and melted SUPER fast. There are definitely hits and misses, but I'm sure there's a flavor for you!"
505,11/16/2016,Irena T.,dallas-2,4,"Would I go out of my way for a popsicle from here?  No.  If I were in the area craving a cooling snack?  Yes.I played it safe and got the Strawberry Lemonade.  It was bright and refreshing, as expected.  $3 for a regular pop and almost $5 for a cookie pop, though..."
506,7/21/2016,Liza K.,dallas-2,4,"Warning: it's extremely difficult to pick a flavor! You'll want to try them all. I settled on the peach cream - right decision!  It was creamy without being heavy, and just the right amount of peach. Btw: this is a new flavor, so go back if you're a regular! So yummy. My friend got the strawberry shortcake which has a sugar cookie in the middle. It was also really good. The strawberry on the outside was fruity and not creamy as you might expect a strawberry shortcake flavored Popsicle to taste. It was surprisingly refreshing and light, but still has chunks of fresh strawberry. I definitely want to go back again to try all the other flavors!!"
507,8/28/2017,Geric S.,dallas-2,5,Who would've thought that these Mexican Paletas would inspire you and make your day less stressful
508,12/22/2016,Matt P.,dallas-2,4,"The perfect solution to the Texas summer sun, with a wide array of flavors to please even the pickiest eaters in your family.Caution: Meltage will ensue, especially if you're strolling about post-lunch. Baby wipes are your best friend, be ready."
509,12/13/2016,Shirley L.,dallas-2,4,"It's a fairly tiny shop but if you go toward the back (towards the bathroom), there's an open window where you can see the production room. Customer service was great, with friendly staff.The menu was long with many different flavors of creamy and fruity pops. Everything sounded delicious; I basically wanted to try it all!! With the help of the cashier, I spent $50 on a box of Popsicles, and left with an assortment of Avocado, Vietnamese Coffee, Coconut, Strawberry, and some fruity ones (which they nicely packed in a box and put some ice bag in since it was like a 40 min drive for me on a hot summer day). I prefer the creamy over fruity pops but nonetheless, I'll be back to try all the other flavors."
510,8/30/2017,JW L.,dallas-2,5,The staff here are always extremely friendly and helpful when it comes to picking flavors.  And there are always lots to choose from. One of my sons said the cookies and cream pop changed the trajectory of his life.  So that's good.
511,6/11/2017,Austin L.,dallas-2,4,We ordered the raspberry lime and watermelon fruity pops. The  raspberry lime was tart and not overly sweet. Perfect complement for a hot summer day.
512,7/5/2016,Lauren W.,dallas-2,5,"$3 per pop is great for some healthy frozen treat...or not so healthy treat ;) Don't be fooled that everything they sell here is geared towards healthy eating so choose carefully if you care about that. You will know that something is not on the healthy side if the calories is not stated on there. But my friend and I tried the chai latte and jasmine green tea, which both didn't have the nutrition information on the site or calories next to the menu. Regardless, those two were some delicious pops that tasted like sweet heaven in my mouth. I will definitely come back or visit other steel city pop to try other flavors. I particularly like this location because the selection is bigger than the one in Austin and that it is next trader Joes so it's great to walk around afterwards. There are other cool stores around there too!! And don't forget to get that hipster shot for the Instagram!"
513,4/18/2017,Monali M.,dallas-2,4,"Best way to end date :) they have amazing options for fruity/water-based pops and cream based options equally. I like fruity and my husband likes creamy. Most importantly they are not excessively sweet as usually case with pops , I will still like options with little less sweet popsicles to quench thirst but I assume there are not many people who likes less sweet popsicles. On side note, We asked them for water and one of the staff happily gave us glass but other staff started pointing it out right in front of us that how she should not give glass of water but force them to buy bottled water which was very unprofessional but they are kids so I won't complain much about it and lower rating based on it. But worth mentioning that it's not unreasonable to give glass of water when one is buying 8$ popsicles ;)"
514,6/4/2016,Gloria C.,dallas-2,5,"I've heard so many reviews and pictures about this place. I got to sample some when they came to my work, so I knew it was good. My husband surprised me with a visit to this place. They were open late which was awesome. There's some seating inside, and also a nice bench area outside. We just parked at Trader Joe's and walked here, so it was very convenient and it felt safer than parking on the busy street. I had the passion fruit pop and my husband had the mango pop. They were both very good. The passion fruit was tart, but I still liked it. The mango one was pretty awesome and it tasted like pure mango. I'm amazed at how they are able to get so much flavor packed into it. And when you suck on it, it's not like you suck out all of the flavor and you're left with ice. It's like the flavor never goes away....so magical! Can't wait to come back and enjoy another flavor. Wish that they open a location in North Dallas."
515,4/12/2017,Ailene S.,dallas-2,5,"I am not a huge fan of popsicles but I am a fanatic when it comes to Steel City Pops! I love their creamy flavors and my go to is typically the coconut or chai latte. The horchata, vanilla bean, and cookies and cream hit the spot for me too. It's hard to decide sometimes! Though their fruity flavors are good they do not make as big of an impression on me, especially when it comes to original flavors."
516,5/26/2016,Ida G.,dallas-2,5,"This is definitely a great place to hit up on a hot summer day or just when your craving something light & sweet!Steel City is definitely the new rage around town. If you go in the summer, the line can curve and go around the block. You can definitely expect to see the line curve around the block. It is always somewhere where you can expect to see a lot of people waiting for it except in the winter months. The process of waiting is quite fast and you can expect to be at the front pretty quickly. The staff is quite friendly and fast! The pops are delicious! They have a variety of submenus such as fruity bars, creamy bars and cookie bars.  The mini does change seasonal but they normally keep a few flavored year round. The bars are definitely quite scrumptious and will want to have you coming back for more!I'm definitely one that has been guilty of eating one bar and come back to get a second Popsicle stick to eat that day. There is definitely a reason why Steel City Pops is so popular!"
517,9/26/2016,Mechelle N.,dallas-2,4,"Steel City Pops is delicious in cold or hot weather it does not matter! I always find myself coming to SCP for dessert after having dinner or just driving all the way just to get a Popsicle. I enjoy this place very much! The environment of this place could be a bit bigger but it is understandable for a ice cream place, it's quick and easy to grab one to go. It's a little too crammed to sit inside so there's a nice bench seating area right in the front! It also has a good area for parking as well unlike the one in Fort Worth, the only downside is the parking spaces are way too small for cars to get in and out. I definitely have to say I prefer the creamy side more, don't get me wrong cause the other Popsicles not milk based are just as delicious. My go to flavors has to be vanilla bean, banana, coffee, and buttermilk. Vanilla bean being my all time favorite. Sometimes, the line goes all the way out the door but the wait is worth it. $3 isn't that pricey to be because you get what you pay for here. All in all, I had a great experience here and I hope others do as much as I do!"
518,12/11/2016,Amanda H.,dallas-2,5,Such a cool spin on dessert! And it feels a lot lighter than eating a piece of cake. I will always go here when going to dallas. Blueberry is my favorite of the fruitys and pistachio is my favorite of the creamys.
519,3/20/2016,Paul V.,dallas-2,5,"It's with great reluctance and shame that I admit it - when Steel City Pops first opened I was a hater. ""A five dollar popsicle? That's stupid."" I would scoff as my friends would rave about the Greenville spot that came in with the wave of goodies brought in once Trader Joe's hit the scene. There was simply no way you could make a business out of something as simple and widely available as a popsicle... right?Wrong. Oh so wrong. Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?Taking on the vibe and decor of your standard ice cream shop (which is more or less what Steel City Pops is... kind of), the process couldn't be anymore straight forward, and I was immediately enticed upon walking in by the simple menu segregation: Fruity, Creamy, Specialty (see: cookie). A cookie popsicle? Oh... oh my. My palms now near sweating with unsuspecting anticipation I ordered a Vanilla Chocolate Chip Cookie pop, forked over $4.50 via credit card (thank god they take credit card, thank you Steel City Pops), and sat there looking at the yet untapped glory in front of me. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?So I'd paid $4.50... for a popsicle (and the most expensive popsicle on the menu at that). While that hadn't fully sunken in prior to taking my first bite, I fired up some quick recollection and realized that in the past I'd gladly paid something close to (or even in excess of) $5.00 for ice cream sandwiches; and isn't that more or less exactly what this was? Creamy ice cream and a cookie on a stick. As you'll soon find no more than a minute later I was realizing that I would have gladly paid $5, $6, or even $8 for this popsicle. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?Plain and simple - this was the perfect dessert. Ice cream sandwiches are my staple, but in a way given the lack of a mess this was even better. Creamy flavorful vanilla ice cream in pop form encased a stick of chocolate chip cookie dough, and the result was more than I could have imagined left to my own devices. I wished right there and then that I could have sampled every single pop available (which was a lot), and I ended up walking away realizing that this was going to be my new go-to dessert spot in Dallas. Dual Stars Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?Yes. I enjoyed my pop more than probably any other dessert in the city much to my surprise, and the uniqueness, quality, and location of Steel City Pops means it's an absolute must visit. Star Granted."
520,3/26/2017,Amanda S.,dallas-2,5,"Seriously the best popsicles I have ever had! They are pretty affordable too. Located off of lower greenville, so the parking isnt the greatest, but no biggie. You can grab a pop and check out all the cool shops around town! Come one, come all, its a ball :-p"
521,7/29/2017,Lauren M.,dallas-2,5,"Delicious popsicles made out of good things!  Strawberry lemonade, lavender lemonade, lime ,chocolate brownie and chocolate were all big hits with our crowd."
522,8/12/2016,Jo L.,dallas-2,5,Yum yum yum!!!! I wish they had a closer location to me but I guess it will Make me drive down this area more. They run out of flavors fast so it's good to go early in the day. I can't wait to try out the all the new  flavors. Oh long lines to be expected.
523,4/24/2016,Jennifer R.,dallas-2,4,Line moves quick. They are very efficient with its of fun flavors including sweet and savory flavors. I got a strawberry lemonade Popsicle and it was light and refreshing. My friend got the vanilla cake Popsicle which she loved. My onto critique would be the shape. It is a little hard to eat it all without it falling off then stick and making a mess because the Popsicle is very wide and your trying to eat at the middle of the stick.
524,9/2/2016,Shirley L.,dallas-2,5,"It's summer time and I'm in for some refreshing sweets. I thought I would order something fruity. But when I entered and saw the creamy menu, I was excited to try their peanut butter and banana flavor. I ordered that and it was delicious ! It tastes like frozen bananas with PB on it. It also wasn't too sweet. The service was great and the popsicle was amazing."
525,8/30/2016,Starla W.,dallas-2,5,Can't say enough good things about this place. Yummy flavored to choose from. Reasonable price. The location is awesome. It's located near shopping and eateries so a great place to stop at for a sweet treat.
526,8/18/2016,Hilary H.,dallas-2,5,"This is my go to when I'm back in Dallas! They have an excellent range of flavors from fruity and light to creamy to decadent ice cream with cookie cores. the calorie counts are listed out on the menu to help you make a ""healthy"" decision or a ""treat yourself"" decision. I'm always tempted by the fresh fruity flavors, especially the strawberry lemonade, but the cookie core flavors are AMAZING and worth the calorie splurge."
527,3/28/2017,Diemeary D.,dallas-2,4,"Loved it here. Popsicle's were so good. Fun little signs to take pictures with... wish was more bigger but all in all staff was so nice, helpful, and gave great recommendations based on cravings."
528,5/19/2017,Tina L.,dallas-2,4,First time I stopped by. Great tasting pops! Passion fruit was a great first time flavor to try. We even bought some to bring home and taste later. All pops are made in house. Cute little to go box to put them in along with ice packs that last up to an hour. I live about 20 min away and all the pops arrived home safely! Can't wait to go back and try all the flavors!
529,2/6/2016,Matt W.,dallas-2,5,"These are some expensive Popsicles, but the chocolate chip cookie dough Popsicle was the bomb.com! I got the 4 for $11, and got two coffee Popsicles and two of the above. The wait was not too long and the only thing I have to complain about is being asked to move our car when we tried to park at the Trader Joes, but what can you expect in this part of town? HahaAnyways, when you start with the Popsicle, you'll taste some chocolate and when you bite into it, you'll get to the chocolate chip cookie dough. It was amazing! You'll get some cookie dough all the way until the end."
530,4/14/2017,W C.,dallas-2,3,"Riddle-us-this: how do ingredients that add up to $0.38 result in a $3.00 pop? We make ice pops at home: it's sugar, water, and fruit. That's it! We've been to S.C.P. quite a few times, as it tends to be where we get our dessert when we're out on lower Greenville, as we were on Tuesday night. The workers here are high school millennials that have no idea how to hustle when it gets busy. The pops themselves are tasty, and it's always nice to hang outside with your friends, but be forewarned that there is nothing special/magical about these pops, as other reviews claim (have they never had a popsicle before?). It's cold blood orange. It's creamy blueberry. Or they douse something in chocolate. Aside: mark our words here about the location on Guadalupe that they're working on now in Austin. It will fail and close quickly. Why? Because they don't understand the area/demographics! It's too far from campus to draw the college kids and there isn't enough parking to make it easier for anyone else interested (especially when Amy's is up the road). You'll see."
531,8/21/2016,Richa T.,dallas-2,3,"Interesting spot in Lower Greenville, but it might not be a place I frequent all the time.Pros:+ Great For Summer weather - who can say no to popsicles in the summer?+ Large Variety - They have quite a few flavors - guaranteed to please everyone+ Cookie Pops - definitely one of the best finds!Cons:- A bit of the pricey side - They're about $3 dollars a pop- Mainstream flavors - I really would have liked to see more unique options - Crowded- Parking is a nightmare!All in all, a decent find if you're in the area on a hot summer day."
532,7/18/2017,Aijha M.,dallas-2,5,"The staff was friendly! I broke my virginity today and had the Passionfruit steel pop and it was delicious. The pops were not sugar, no artificial floors, ALL NATURAL AND REAL FRUIT & SWEETS! Next time I want to try extra toppings like chocalate dip with coconut flakes.... yumm"
533,6/15/2016,Christina P.,dallas-2,5,"I was in Dallas for less than three days but still managed to visit Steel City Pops twice. One time I even stood in a thunderstorm enjoying my pop - these pops are that good! The concept is so simple: house made pops in 'fruity' and 'creamy' varieties, with some specialty cookie pops as well. The menu is long and extremely hard to choose from as everything sounds so delicious: strawberry balsamic, lavender lemonade, caramel, chai latte, blueberry basil... you really can't go wrong. I tried two creamy varieties: the jasmine green tea was my favorite - not too perfumey, perfectly creamy. On the next visit, I wanted to try their new piña colada flavor and wasn't disappointed at all - loved the chunks of pineapple throughout! The space is tiny but there's room to enjoy your pop in the comfort of an air conditioned room, and if you go toward the back you can see the room where the tasty pops are made. It's sparkling clean, and you may see a dude walk out wearing a big parka in the middle of the summer if he's been working in the freezer! Though the place exudes a friendly vibe and the service is cheerful and helpful, I thought it was funny that the entire rest of the neighborhood seems to be pretty annoyed at those sticky, drippy pops. I walked into several other businesses that had signs forbidding popsicles, and even the public benches are surrounded by a dark sticky puddle from people enjoying on a hot, melty day. Personally I love these guys and wish there was one in New York!"
534,3/14/2016,Meghan D.,dallas-2,5,"I love Steel City Pops! These make for a great treat on a warm day. Their pops are unlike any popsicle you can buy at a grocery store or elsewhere. I had the Iced Lemon Pie (a creamy lemon pop with graham cracker in it) and the Vanilla Chocolate Chip (a vanilla pop with a chocolate chip cookie in it)--they were delicious! They were $3 each, which seemed very reasonable for a yummy homemade pop. There is both inside and outside seating, though I brought mine home. Parking on East Greenville is a challenge. (+) delicious pops(+) seating(-) parking"
535,1/19/2016,Jen T.,dallas-2,5,SCP has plenty of options and was a great little pit stop after dinner. The pops have plenty of flavor and are great for warm nights. My nieces and nephews loved all the options and picking them out of the freezer. I know at $3 a pop it can get pricey but they are made with real ingredients and it's a nice treat that you wouldn't get every day. When I'm in the area I will have to stop back by to try another flavor.
536,7/19/2017,Caleb M.,dallas-2,4,"When I looked at the ingredients on the menu I thought ""oh wow this DESSERT sounds so healthy- it can't POSSIBLY be good!"" Being wrong has never tasted so delicious! I've got a huge sweet tooth and Steel City Pops hit the spot! I ordered a classic vanilla pop with the chocolate chip cookie inside and may have scarred a few of the other customers with how fast I scarfed it down (before promptly ordering another). The staff was very accommodating to this skeptical sugar-addict - we happily chatted about my state of disbelief that something so simple could taste so decadent! They're the perfect treats to help beat the summer heat. Do y'all's selves a favor and get one before the season is up, you won't be disappointed!"
537,6/14/2016,Lyn N.,dallas-2,5,"Avocado and piña colada flavors are sooo delicious and creamy. It made me want more and I sure did go get more. No shame in my popsicle game! Strawberry lemonade, recommended by one the employees, is a house favorite. It was refreshing and all.....butttt I preferred the creamy flavors more. It was more tart than fruity. I vote Creamy over Fruity. For now. Anyway, I'm super stoked for their Houston location!! So stoked that I'm thinking about applying for a part time job there lol :D"
538,8/20/2016,Alice Z.,dallas-2,5,"I love popsicles! The classic water-based ones, not the creamy ones. It's the perfect treat for a hot summer day. Cool and refreshing. I wished they had stores all over Texas. Usually, I will try to go for the unique flavors because you can't buy a box of them at the grocery store. Some I've had: -rhubarb-cucumber lime-raspberry lemonade-strawberry lemonade (classic good flavor if you are not feeling adventurous)The menu changes seasonally with new flavors, so there is always something new to try. There are two types of popsicle eaters in this world: the biters and the suckers. The consistency of the pops here are good enough to satisfy both types. Note for Klyde Warren cart: Please stock your supply boxes with hole punches for the punch cards. I've been here many times, but I can never get my card punched."

Updated review",Stephanie D.,dallas-2,5,STILL THE BEST POPSICLES EVER - had the Vanilla Chocolate Chip popsicle and it was vanilla ice cream + chocolate chip cookie heaven. It has a literal chocolate chip cookie in it. I will continue to keep coming here because the popsicles are so darn good.I can't even really call them popsicles; they are works of delicious dessert art.

Updated review",Erin O.,dallas-2,5,"Alright... I'm gonna lay down a 5 star edit right here. After sweating hard on the absolutely beautiful River Legacy trails in Arlington, we looped back around to the main area and stumbled upon a dude with a tiny umbrella covered wheel cart selling Steel City popcicles on Food Truck Fridays at the park!  FUCKING SCORE!!!!  We went back on Fridays repeatedly thereafter until it got so hot, haha."
541,5/24/2016,Michelle L.,dallas-2,5,"In California, we were fans of paletas (fruit based pops) and gelato pops. Steep City Pops is the same concept except more hipster and it's ice cream. I heard that Steel City Pops originated in Alabama but thankfully for me they also had a location in Dallas. We went on a Friday night and there was a line. But do not be deterred because it moves very quick! There are also a bunch of chairs that you can sit on outside while you enjoy your popsicles. For $3 you get your pick from a list popsicles. They are divided into two categories: Fruity and Creamy. We opted to pick one from each category and went with the Raspberry Lemonade and Creamy Coffee. Out of the two, my favorite was the Coffee. But then again I might be biased because I adore coffee ice cream so this was kind of perfect for me. It was creamy and had the right amount of coffee taste. I stole it from my fiancé half way through. The Raspberry Lemonade was as fruity as you can get. That tart raspberry flavor just came through so nicely and it was a great treat. It literally tasted like pureed raspberries which is what you're looking for in a fruit based bar. If I had to pick again, I would gravitate towards the creamy category because it was more reminiscent of a dessert. I hope to be back soon Steel City Pops! Keep it up! 5/5"
542,6/10/2017,Rachel S.,dallas-2,4,"Absolutely delicious but a little overpriced. I recognize that there is overhead involved with running the operation so they need to charge as much as they reasonably can for a popsicle (it's business, I get it) but I don't see myself regularly spending three dollars plus tax on a simple popsicle. At that point I'd rather pay an extra couple dollars somewhere else and get a real ice cream cone, or a sundae."
543,6/22/2016,Sarah S.,dallas-2,5,"Went here with my friend for her birthday and the popsicles were a wonderful treat! I LOVE the location, and even on a hot day it is very enjoyable. I got a mango popsicle and was so surprised to hear it was only $3, as these pops are very gourmet. I am so excited to return and try other wonderful flavors."
544,7/25/2016,Derrick C.,dallas-2,5,"Love the place, love the concept, love the flavors, love the taste. Only wish was that it wasn't as pricey per popsicle, but understand how they need to stay profitable and that we're paying for out-of-the-ordinary, specialty flat popsicles. This was our first visit to the Dallas location after trying the Fort Worth location a few times. They're the exact same, just a different restaurant footprint/layout.Between my wife and our 2 young kids, we shared 2 - the cherry sour cream and the peach cream. Both were delicious, as expected. We'll definitely be back when we're in or around the area. Wish there was one in North Dallas!"
545,7/2/2016,Rick B.,dallas-2,5,"I admit that I was skeptical when friends told me that these popsicles were worth $3/each.  Sounds crazy to a tightwad like me. But this place is great!  My wife had the vanilla and chocolate chip cookie pop, and I stuck to plain old chocolate - both tasted fantastic!  Now she wants to go back for the Strawberry Shortcake!  Who knows what I'll try, but enough about us. You need to go!Wait in a short line and choose from exotic fruits to creamy ice cream style bars - with cakes and cookies in the middle if you're bold enough!  Yumm!"
546,6/25/2016,Steve S.,dallas-2,3,"Steel City Pops is a brilliant business idea that is just good for customers, and great for the proprietors, who are making piles of money on a very high margin product selling in very high volumes.  The have one upped Starbucks, in this regard.As a customer, I loved the fresh handmade pop concept and selection, executed in a solid if not great pop product.  In the 100 degree heat of the summer, I hated the lack of seating in which to enjoy the pop, and the large crowd of tightly packed sweaty bodies jammed in the place like sardines, in the middle of a Saturday afternoon.At $3 per pop (get it?), we'll score a box at the grocery store next time instead, especially when the weather outside is very hot, rainy, or cold, accordingly."

Updated review",Coco Z.,dallas-2,3,My only favorite is pistachio and buttermilk but they donot have it all the timeThe rest of milk based pops leave a thick waxy coating on the roof of my mouth and my friends- very unpleasant Fruit based flavors are ok
548,6/24/2016,Kevin Y.,dallas-2,4,"Has great popsicles with so many flavors that it is hard to choose. I ended up getting the strawberry shortcake. The strawberry flavor really comes through and having an actual cookie like core in the popsicle was a very interesting twist. The cookie didn't have too much taste to it but it did make the popsicle more exciting.The service is nice and I heard that if you don't like the popsicle you got after taking a bite, you could exchange it for another one free of charge. Also, they have this deal for a ""gift card"" for 4 popsicles for $11. Considering each popsicle is at least $3 and some are more, this is definitely a great deal for anyone going with a group of people."
549,6/12/2017,Judy S.,dallas-2,5,"The best most creative flavors to ever be put on a stick! Favorite flavor I ever had was carrot cake (seasonal). All fruit flavors and cream flavors are dressed up in stores , not at carts. Had avocado dipped in white chocolate rolled in salted pistachos -yummy"
550,4/19/2016,Nish K.,dallas-2,5,"This place mints money, being the only ice cream-popsicle place on Greenville Ave. If there is a line, just walk around and return in 5 minutes and find yourself at the front. However, if you want to wait, the line moves pretty quick.They have 2 main options: fruity or creamy. I prefer the creamy options and have tried the vanilla bean, vanilla chocolate chip, chocolate, satsuma cream and buttermilk. The fruity ones are a little too tangy for me but still pretty good!!All the popsicles are made from natural/organic ingredients and are sweetened with cane sugar so you know you are getting the good stuff... One popsicle has a lot less calories than a single scoop of ice cream and tastes a lot better IMO.**Don't forget to pick up your frequent use card. **Parking is at the rear of the shop and can get messy - tight spots and an uneven road. **You can get a popsicle box and they will pack it good so you can drive off an enjoy your popsicle at a later time. **They have seasonal flavors and I would recommend trying then when you can. The butter pecan was one of them, which I am absolutely in love with."
551,1/31/2017,Amara O.,dallas-2,5,"They're pops. Not sure how you can screw them up, but if you do, you now know where it's done right. I'm lactose intolerant so I can't say much about the cream pops, but the fruit ones have yet to disappoint. Tip! Try the lavender lemonade when you get a chance. On a gorgeous day they're the perfect accessory to a sweet tooth and a touch of curiosity.   Plus, you'll feel all too classy when they ask you what you've got."
552,11/6/2016,Jo J.,dallas-2,3,very tasty pops! my only disappointment is that I was unaware of the dips and toppings that u can add. I wished the staff had informed newbies like myself of the extra toppings. it would prob make each bite much more delightful to enjoy!
553,12/14/2016,Justin M.,dallas-2,5,"Best $3 I've spent in a long time. I enjoy their ever changing seasonal flavors year round. My friends and I are never disappointed and we are very picky crowd. Something for everyone, sweet without being too much and also naturally low in calories."
554,6/17/2017,Cassie S.,dallas-2,5,"Love this place! The ice tea, blackberry, avocado, and cookie pop flavors are so good. I'm pretty sure every single one is delicious. The creativity of the flavors are awesome and the team is always really nice."
555,12/21/2016,Nissy P.,dallas-2,4,"People talk non stop about how amazing Steel City is and I'll have to say I agree when I comes to certain pops! I got a vanilla cookie pop and my friend got a mango pop. I personally liked the mango pop better! It was so refreshing and tasted so fresh. The vanilla cookie pop was almost bland to me, especially when it came to the cookie portion. Also, I just wish there was more seating because the place was packed and we were just standing out side with our melting pops in our hands trying to eat as quickly as possible. It would have been a lot more enjoyable had we had a place to"
556,6/6/2017,Jennifer D.,dallas-2,5,Yummy!!  I had a buttermilk popsicle dipped in dark chocolate and dusted in graham crackers!!  Can't wait to bring my kids back!!
557,6/26/2015,Tiffany S.,dallas-2,3,"I love popsicles so why was I not impressed by this Steel City location? When I visited in Fort Worth, I was head over heels. This time I just felt like ""meh"". Well, let me explain.1) Steel City is not easy to get to. Sure, it's right on Greenville but finding a parking spot is like winning the lottery aka something that doesn't happen to me. After driving around aimlessly, I parked at TJ's and even walked around the store to make my parking situation seem legit. 2) The popsicles are $3. Yeah yeah, I know.3) I ordered the passionfruit, which is one of my favorite flavors of all time. The pop seemed a bit dry and not juicy enough. Sounds weird but as a lover of popsicles, I notice these things. 4) The worker was nice but she took my wrapper off for me. That was kind of awkward. Is that normal to prevent mass littering?Now that I've had my Steel City fix, I don't know that I'll be back anytime soon."
558,6/25/2015,Christine P.,dallas-2,5,"I LOVVEEE STEEL CITY! But the thing is, I'm only in love with one of their flavors. STRAWBERRY CREAM ALL THE WAYYYOther flavors I like:-avocado (tastes kind of limey which I liked!)-coffee (tastes like reg. coffee ice cream)-vanilla chocolate chip (so gooood)-orange mint green tea (tastes refreshing but only thing I don't like about the fruity bars is the texture and the sound it makes when you crunch into it. You'll know what I mean)Other flavors I tried and didn't like:-blueberry cream (I had high hopes for this one since I love their strawberry cream so much but this was just way too sweet for me)Line is usually long but goes quickly and is worth it :-) Fort Worth location is not usually packed/don't have to wait as long as Dallas location. Some workers are friendly and I've only encountered one stiff-ish worker who didn't seem to enjoy her job but I get it, work is work I guess. But smile, you'll look better!"
559,8/7/2015,Thi Q.,dallas-2,2,"Over rated. After seeing all the hypes about this place, I decided to try to since I was in the area. The popsicles wasn't as flavorful as what I expected. The only thing that make this place special are the fruit flavors and it's made with real fruits."
560,7/17/2016,Jeff N.,dallas-2,4,"There's nothing like a ice cold Popsicle to beat the Texas heat. As usual, when we arrived there was a line out the door, but it usually moves quickly. Nestled in the lower Greenville area, Steel City Pops adds nicely to the wonderful variety of food goodness in this part of town. The Popsicles are always very ice cold, but not so hard that you can't bite into it. The variety of flavors is quite large, and I usually stick to the basics. Tonight I had the raspberry lemonade which as usual, was full of flavor and fruity goodness. The storefront is clean, nice, and at the same time much so, lacking in places to sit. Outside there is a border of benches surrounding but next to zero seating inside. Considering the amount of people coming in, it'd be nice to have more options to sit and enjoy one's pop. Many people were using the tables next door from the (now closed) Project Pie. Although flavorful and tasty, the pops do taste quite sugary. I also don't believe any of the pops I tried were organic. It would be a nice option if some of their fruit pops were made from organic ingredients. If I am I correct in saying so please do tell me. If you haven't been, check it out. I doubt you'll be disappointed."
561,10/25/2016,Claire C.,dallas-2,4,"Honestly only ate here so we could use their parking spot for going to Truck Yard for dinner. But it was good! I had a toasted marshmallow pop and it was really creamy and had a campfire taste. But I would call it an ice cream bar, not a popsicle. The fruit based ones looked like popsicles. The cream based ones were ice cream. I was expecting it to be more expensive than it was, but it seemed reasonably priced."
562,6/7/2015,Charlotte J.,dallas-2,5,"Wowza! This place seriously impressed us. Drove up to Lower Greenville on a hot Sunday afternoon looking for a cool treat, and we found it. Parking wasn't too hard (there are several lots behind the building where customers can park). There was a line out the door, but it went very quickly. It's a cute little storefront, with just a few seats along the bar in the window and a few outside in the shade, but it was packed, so we took our popsicles to go. My boyfriend selected the Blood Orange pop ($3) and I selected the Vanilla Brownie pop ($4.50). They pull your popsicle out of one of their two large freezers and unwrap the plastic for you, offering it to you stick first. The whole ordering process takes about 30 seconds, which accounts for the speedy line. Vanilla Brownie: All I can say is YES. This is heaven on a stick. Creamy, sweet, delicious vanilla encircles a dense, chewy dark chocolate brownie. As the popsicle melts it almost seems that one side of the stick is pure ice cream and the other side is pure brownie, and that is just how life should be. 275 calories (worth it). Blood Orange: The flavors here are intense. It has a sweet, robust orange flavor that lingers on your tastebuds. Not a bit tart or bitter, just sweet and simple and super refreshing. (Around 100 calories). Wish we could have tried every flavor. We'll be back to do just that."
563,5/18/2017,Christopher P.,dallas-2,5,1st timers here last night and we will be coming back.  I had the choco brownie dipped and dredged! Next time I'm going for the banana.
564,9/19/2015,Tung N.,dallas-2,5,"Steel City made Popsicles, out of all things, a raging fad. It took everyone by storm, and it's no surprise that it's still finding great success. These Popsicles are a great alternative to the typical cupcake desserts. They have two kinds of pops: fruity & creamy. I get fruity 9 out of 10 times. Their flavors are unique and delicious, and most pops you can get for under 100 calories (great for a health nut like me). I got the Strawberry Lemonade this time around, and it was just as good as any of the other pops I ever had. Just the right sweetness to cut the tartness of the lemonade. Yum. Definitely stop by to get a refreshing pop if you're in the area!!"
565,5/4/2017,Tina P.,dallas-2,5,"Absolutely delicious! Hate to find parking in this area, but worth looking just to get these pops!!!"
566,7/24/2015,Richard T.,dallas-2,4,"Took a day off and came here for the first time, middle of the day on a Thursday, and boyyyy was this place still packed. It was HOTTTT outside and nothing better than a frozen treat to cool you off. Located on Greenville, across from trader joes and such. Parking isn't that great in the area.On to my pop. I got a creamy cookie pop - vanilla choc chip, I think? But it was amazing. Tasted like cookie dough, kind of, but better. One draw back was that the ice cream melted ridiculously fast in the heat and so it was dripping down my hands. Great place though, come on through."
567,6/28/2015,Marian Q.,dallas-2,5,"I am obsessed with this place. O B S E S S E D! There are a number of mouth watering flavors (from fruity to creamy)- the 2 that I have had the pleasure to try: coconut & coffee chocolate. Both were excellent, but I preferred the coconut over the cookie pop because it was light and refreshing in the summer heat.I'm an out of town visitor and I really wish I could take this Popsicle store with me! But for now, I'll just be a frequent visitor when I am able to spend time in Dallas. Tip: try to snag a seat inside (though seating is pretty limited), otherwise you'll have a drippy (but delicious) mess on your hands. The patio is pretty cute, but it's HOT out there!"
568,1/21/2016,Anne S.,dallas-2,5,"I don't have much to say that hasn't already been said except:CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE POP.If you have been here, especially multiple times, and haven't tried this little slice of heaven, DO SO IMMEDIATELY.  If you haven't ever been here, GO IMMEDIATELY and don't even be tempted by anything else on the menu.This was quite possibly one of the most amazing desserts I've ever had -- and believe me, I was a BIG skeptic of the popsicle thing, having never liked them much as a kid (too icy and too messy and not nearly as tasty as other dessert options).  Steel City Pops are NOTHING like the popsicles you ate as a kid.  The ice cream melts at the PERFECT rate so that it's never icy and never drippy -- always smooth and creamy and perfectly easily edible.  And oh my gosh, the flavor of the vanilla ice cream itself was divine, cookie or no.Next time, I'm buying a box of 12..."
569,4/17/2017,Kaleb M.,dallas-2,4,"We were walking down the road and stopped by here for dessert. I got a creamy blueberry pop covered in milk chocolate. It was good! I wish I would have put more toppings or a drizzle on mine, because it was relatively boring."
570,1/26/2016,Sara T.,dallas-2,5,"I can't believe I waited this long to stop by. I honestly thought this was just going to be some sugared out piece of ice that was overrated. I was SO wrong. Seriously!After trying the vanilla chocolate chip Popsicle last night, I'm a changed woman. It was perfection on a stick. Ice-cream on a stick. Creamy, delicious, satisfying and everything else good on a stick. I'm not a huge fan of fruity Popsicles but I loved the fact that they have creamy options too!! Not overly sweet, yet sweet enough. I would honestly even want to try their fruity ones, just because of the simple fact that the creamy ones are so simple and delicious. So many flavors to pick from, which is a great thing because I can always try something new. Can't wait to bring my BF here and come back myself.Y'all have to try it if you haven't already!"
571,3/30/2016,Kacy M.,dallas-2,4,"These popsicles are the healthy alternative to ice cream cones. They're very creamy and packed with flavor. The menu offers a few regulars but every time I've been there's always something new. I've had the cookies and cream, blood orange, and mango. There's a small bar with stools inside you can sit at but people usually get their pops to go. The price can be a turnoff since you can spend $4ish on a box of pops from the grocery store instead of just one, but I think it's one of those once in a while treats that's ok to splurge on."
572,2/8/2016,Mai L.,dallas-2,5,"I've only been here once but once was enough. Completely in love with this place! Will be back every chance I get. I got the coffee popsicle. It was not too sweet and really creamy, which I liked. Staff was also very friendly and they have great store hours. They're open pretty late on the weekends."
573,3/27/2016,Austin C.,dallas-2,5,"Whoa! Popsicles and creamsicles! This place located on a very trendy Greenville St. I got pretty lucky with my curbside parking spot, but there's plenty of perpendicular street parking. Steel City Pops is quick, receipt free and they don't ask for tips. There's a reason why this place has such a great review score. Stop in for some friendly service and amazing Popsicles."
574,11/12/2016,Darnecia P.,dallas-2,5,"Such a great concept for a popsicle place for anyone remotely concerned about the type of food that's consumed! There are an abundance of flavors to choose from and you can even dredge or dip your popsicle in chocolate, candy, etc. My popsicle tasted like it was made with love!"
575,2/25/2015,Larry F.,dallas-2,5,"Steel City Pops is undoubtedly one of my favorite places in Dallas.  This place is a ""MUST GO TO"". What is there not to love about custom-made (in house), locally-sourced popsicles? Come in several varieties - fruity (think strawberry balsamic, blackberry, hibiscus ~70 Calories), creamy (think peanut butter, coffee), and cookie pop (chocolate with brownie - unbelievably good ~230 Calories). Flavors are unique. Each flavor is amazing. Seriously, I take all my friends and family members here, and after sampling the majority of popsicles offered, I can honestly say they have all been good. Service is always friendly and welcoming. Although there may be a line, it goes very quickly.In short, grab a popsicle at Steel City Pops. You won't regret it."
576,8/16/2015,Nancy T.,dallas-2,5,"Three words. DOT. DOT. DOT.This place is really popular! Lines out the door. Friendly service. Pretty much everything about this place gave me a newfound love for ice cream. More so, Popsicles.This place is so busy that there are lines out side the door. Lines wrapping around the store and around the corner. But don't worry because the wait is but only 5 minutes or less. There's so many FRESH FRUIT, creamy flavors. There were so much to choose from. I couldn't decide. My friend that was in line before me got strawberry shortcake. I took a bite and SWEET DANCING BABY JESUS. That first bite was HEAVEN. I was next in line and immediately knew what I wanted. STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE, PLEASE!OH LAWD.Meeting up with my friends, I asked to take a bite out of every single one of their Popsicles. HOT DIGGITY. Everything tasted so GOOD. It's not something you would buy at a grocery store. It's freshly made and packaged in clear plastic wrapping and they open it for you. There's a calorie count for all you health watching people.Parking is not great. Good luck.For a $3 pop, totally worth it. I'm pretty cheap but this place is well worth it. Whenever I'm in the Dallas area, this will be the first thing on my mind."
577,7/30/2015,Farran M.,dallas-2,3,"Steel City Pop is the trendy place to go in Dallas, so I had to see what the hype was all about. I ordered a coconut popsicle and it was just ""okay"". I had piña colada on my mind, so my taste buds were disappointed. It's a really small place, so it gets awkwardly crowded on busy days. There is a small seating area in the front that's shaded. Next time I'll try another flavor, but it's a very cute business overall."
578,4/2/2015,Samantha L.,dallas-2,5,"Cannot believe I'm just now discovering this place. Finally got to try it for myself! Did. not. disappoint. At a whopping $3 per organic, gluten-free popsicle, you have a choice between fruity flavors, creamy flavors, and cookie flavors. Mm. At the recommendation of the friendly (and handsome) cashier, my sister got the raspberry lemonade bar and I happily handed over my plastic for the strawberry cream bar. The flavors were on point, and the texture was very well executed. I would just like to point out the fact that complaining about the price is silly as they are being responsible by putting wholesome ingredients into each popsicle. Quality, people!Take the kiddos, a date, or hell, even by yourself and snag a little piece of heaven on a gorgeous summer dayI almost, ALMOST went back in for a second one lol. #getalltheflavors!"
579,4/9/2017,Amber H.,dallas-2,5,Loved my jalapeño pineapple popsicle and the service was top notch as well. The lady working there helped me pick out what was right for me and was super nice! I will be back next time I am in Dallas!
580,1/18/2017,Gwen S.,dallas-2,5,I so love this place best popsicles around! The jasmine tea pop is my favorite and the classic vanilla bean is making my mouth water now ! I think I need to stop by later today for one ......
581,10/29/2016,Michael M.,dallas-2,5,"After leaving a business dinner across the street, I wanted to check it out based upon the reviews.  My two business associates proceeded in making for of me for wanting popsicles, I bought three and we began driving back towards the hotel.  About 5 minutes into the drive I turned the car around so we could all get seconds.  The ice cream was very fresh and the flavors were spot on!"
582,2/14/2016,David G.,dallas-2,4,Great place everything is very fresh. unfortunately they were out of the number flavors because they're so busy. Lines typically very long as business is booming. Great patient staff.
583,3/17/2015,Ingrid A.,dallas-2,4,"This place is super hip & happenin'.The first time I came here, I ordered the avocado - it lacked the richness of typical avocado-flavored desserts because I think they add some lime to add a kick of freshness, so it was more sour than it was sweet & creamy. Needless to say, I was disappointed with my $3 popsicle and immediately dubbed this place ""that overpriced, overrated popsicle place."" I was just salty.I decided to give this place another shot today and was pleasantly surprised! They are serving up some NEW COOKIE POPS(!), which have gluten-free brownies/cookies frozen INTO the popsicle. The vanilla brownie flavor was amazing, and the brownie, though frozen within the popsicle, remained soft and chewy. The vanilla popsicle was rich and creamy. The entire vanilla brownie popsicle experience was wonderful. And I am not typically a calorie-counter, but for only 270+ calories, this sweet treat is almost healthy! (Lol, kidding, but if it makes you feel any better, I'm here for you.)My friend ordered cucumber lime, which was super fresh and refreshing, but not something I would typically order. The flavor was spot-on though.Anyway, though that cookie pop was great and high-quality, I'm not sure how easily I would pay $4.50 for one next time around. We shall see!"
584,6/21/2015,Diane W.,dallas-2,3,"This place is great for an after meal or hot day treat. I've been here a couple times and it doesn't seem to ever disappoint. Everything is organic or fresh made, and the flavors hold pretty true to the name. Now although it's a little pricey at 3 bucks, I would say definitely try it outI have had guava, lime, and strawberry lemonade- all of which were really good!"
585,3/11/2016,Luis V.,dallas-2,5,"I am an ice cream and gelato fan. I go out for ice cream every Sunday and I like trying new shops and crazy flavors. On that note, I have never been a Popsicle person. But then I found out about Steel City Pops.Their pops are incredible. Super creamy and light. It is the one and only type of Popsicle I allow myself to eat.If you are ever in lower Greenville, it's a must!Recommendation: any. You can't go wrong."
586,7/4/2016,David F.,dallas-2,3,"The pops are pretty good here, but I don't understand the hype about it. I would suggest a flavor but they change a lot so it probably wouldn't help"
587,4/2/2017,Mars ..,dallas-2,4,"yum! it reminds me of a place in downtown little rock, ar called le pops. I originally ordered a strawberry lemonade pop and though it tasted good, the flavor wasn't as concentrated and expected and I tasted my mum's vanilla bean and that sold me. I was hesitant about a savory flavor because I thought they'd be too icy as they are popsicles and not ice cream (I wanted the butter pecan inspired pop but that wasn't on yesterday's menu), but they nailed it. I opted for a vanilla bean pop drizzled and white chocolate and dredged in pecans. I will be back."
588,11/11/2015,Su L.,dallas-2,4,"Who doesn't go to Steel City Pops when they're on lower Greenville?  Who?  This is one of the few places in the area that will more often than not have a line out the door at any given time.They have a myriad of popsicle flavors to choose from.  My favorites are the cream based ones.  Beware, these pops tend to melt significantly faster than the fruit based pops.  The cream pops are creamy, of course, and are incredibly flavorful.Service can be a bit slow since there's never more than 2 folks at the counter - sometimes one on weekdays since there's slightly less traffic in lower Greenville Monday - Thursday.  So if you have some asshat taking their sweet time choosing popsicles or just being obnoxious, be prepared to wait a few moments.Apparently starting next week (for those of you who can't maths), November 16th, they're going to to start serving coffee.  From the guy at the counter who told us about this in the first place, the coffee is supposed to be pretty tasty.  They even have a cute but heavy duty espresso machine.  P.S. they have a punch card/frequency card - whatever the hell you want to call them.  I always forget about this but just a heads up that these babies do exist!"
589,11/27/2014,Anthony N.,dallas-2,4,"***Steel City Pops features fruit-based pops (like paletas) as well as ice cream pops that deliver a very creamy and satisfying gourmet ice cream experience***There are several artisan ice cream parlors across the country, but Steel City Pops offers a slightly more unique take on ice cream.  Instead of ice cream by the scoop, Steel City Pops features fruit-based pops (paletas) as well as a wide variety of ice cream pops.  Their ice cream pops immediately look like something you might see in the frozen aisle of your local grocery store, but the pops at Steel City Pops deliver a much more satisfying experience.Those grocery store ice cream pops (even high-end ones from Haagen-Dazs) do not really taste like ice cream.  The ice cream is too frozen, too icy and too hard.  Those ice cream pops lack the creaminess and softness of great ice cream to deliver a true ice cream on a stick experience.The ice cream pops at Steel City Pops are different though.  It is less of a bite ice cream pop and more of a lick ice cream pop.  The ice cream is smooth and has very little iciness.  They have a great variety of flavors too from traditional flavors to more unique flavors like carrot cake and tomatillo salsa.I really like their butter pecan ice cream pop.  It was sweet and the pecans were great.  They were crunchy and not overly sugary where you can identify and feel the individual sugar crystals.  Instead, the pecans here provided a good crunch to go with the smooth ice cream.Their carrot cake ice cream pop also came with perfectly roasted and seasoned pecans.  The carrot cake flavor was nice too--sweet but with a noticeable carrot cake flavor.If desired, you can also get ice cream pops freshly dipped in dark chocolate.Prices are not too bad here.  The ice cream pops are definitely more expensive than what you will find at a grocery store, but they are also significantly more satisfying (they also feature higher quality ingredients).Service was very good--very personable.Steel City Pops has a simple space with a glass display case showcasing their fruit-based and ice cream-based pops.  There is also a counter with stools that runs along the store window.Steel City Pops is a great frozen dessert option in Dallas.  It is also unique and not something you can easily find in other big cities.  In addition, Steel City Pops is located in Lower Greenville, which features several inviting local restaurants, so it is a great option for dessert after a nice lunch on this street.There is a free parking lot behind Steel City Pops.  Free street parking is also available."
590,3/4/2017,Phil M.,dallas-2,5,"Great alternative to ice cream or cake after dinner. Sized just right. Lots of flavors, I had a banana pop, they put pecans and chocolate on it, fantatic"
591,1/30/2016,Tia R.,dallas-2,4,"I don't know how they do it, but their popsicles are simply ah-mazing!My favorite is pistachio.  I can't get enough pistachio.  They put so much pistachio. It just goes to show, if you just put mo', people will go, crazy for pistachio. (Sorry, it turned into a rap).They have so many great flavors.  It is impossible to decide at times.  The great thing is, you can bring some home.  They will package it up for you in some styrofoam, so you can have another flavor later. This place is definitely worth the trip every time."
592,1/8/2016,Iris L.,dallas-2,4,"Came here a few months back with my friend. Very cute storefront with a great seating area outside.  I tried the vanilla chocolate chip pop and my friend got the strawberry lemonade.I think this is a really hip place, might be a great end of date night destination- parking can stink. But some truly original flavors. I would love to try more when in the area!"
593,9/2/2016,Tonia G.,dallas-2,5,"OMG!!! Can you say ""Ice Creaaaammmm""  Like your running for the best Ice Cream truck???  This place came to my job for an event and now We go to the shop itself.  This place is the business!!  Made with all the best ingredients of fruit.  Passion Fruit and Strawberry Lemonade are my top picks now!!"
594,8/10/2016,Stephanie N.,dallas-2,4,"This place is a very cute idea. I've been twice and the Popsicles I have gotten are very good. My only complaint is both times I have gone (a week apart) they have been out of the same flavor. If you're out, I recommend erasing it off your item board.The counter staff is very sweet and nice. Helpful with recommendations. And these pops do taste great on super hot, Texas summer days."
595,1/18/2016,Jessica S.,dallas-2,5,"mmmmmm the chocolate pop is amazing y'all! I've been here a few times and I always order the chocolate or the coffee pop. I recommend the creamy pops but I have also heard the sweet tea pop is amazing. Whether you're looking for a dessert or a yummy treat after a great workout (LOL), this is your place! PRO TIP: Ask for a frequent buyer card. After your 10th pop, you get one for free! All locations accept this card (not just greenville location)."
596,8/2/2016,Stella C.,dallas-2,5,"Gluten free, organic and not so sweet! Refreshing test for Texas summer heat! All their flavors are so good. My all time favorite is Lavander lemonade, coffee and strawberry lemonade. I'm trying to get a new flavors everytime I visit the shop! I usually ask the staff about their favorite flavor and take it from there!Be warned, it's very addicting!"
597,7/16/2016,Lynda N.,dallas-2,5,"This place keeps taking my money. I need to avoid the Lower Greenville area more frequently. ;) The popsicle flavors and quality are solid here. My first popsicle flavor was mango, and I thought it was tasty and refreshing. My absolute favorites are the cookie pops! Try the Vanilla Chocolate Chip and Strawberry Shortcake flavors. You'll thank me later. Lastly, customer service is always quick and friendly."
598,10/19/2015,Alex S.,dallas-2,5,"This place is excellent. The people working there are friendly and cheerful, and the menu never gets old. I know that a big comment is that it's expensive- $3 for a Popsicle- but if you were going out for an ice cream scoop or a great cookies, you'd probably be looking at a similar price. So far, I have only tried two flavors: watermelon and Rosemary plum. The watermelon was basically sunshine on a stick and the most summery pink it could be. I had planned to get that again, but it was no longer on the menu, so I went for Rosemary plum. I think their Popsicles are so excellent because they are super fruity, rather than watery/ice-filled. It's also fun to see what new tastes are on the menu. There is a fig one I am just hoping to get a chance to try before the next menu rotation!!! They also seem to offer excellent seasonal flavors, so pumpkin is on my list and I am crossing my fingers for an eggnog this winter!"
599,5/31/2016,Jennifer L.,dallas-2,4,"Got the white tea champagne and it was really refreshing and I didn't get sick of it! I'm not huge on popsicles or ice cream but I would come back if I was in the area on a hot day. I also really liked the strawberry lemonade. $3 a pop is a bit pricey but if you like them, I think it could be worth it."
600,4/1/2015,Tiffany W.,dallas-2,5,"My first SCP was at a scholarship event at school where I got the Butter Pecan Popsicle. Probably my favorite pop-come back soon!! (It's seasonal). Then this past week I came here twice and got the 1-Vanilla Chocolate chip cookie pop and 2-Coffee. 1-recommended by the staff cashier. He was pretty helpful! Since I couldn't decide, I just got his favorite and didn't regret it! Got it right before it closed and there was no remorse from the staff. They take out the wrapper for you to hold without the plastic!2- also good! It was a bit hot outside so my Popsicle melted pretty fast. Make sure you grab some napkins if it's hot outSummer's coming, I'll be a frequent!"
601,1/25/2016,Jeanne Y.,dallas-2,5,"Get the creamy pops! My personal favorite is the vanilla bean and the coffee one.Steel city pops should be on the top of everyone's Dallas bucket list. They're not only delicious, but also very affordable. They're definitely worth the hype."
602,4/4/2016,David F.,dallas-2,3,This place is good and they have unique flavors but why so expensive? I buy popsicles from push cart vendors for 1/3 of the price and they taste just as good. I guess its just a cool place to go because the line gets pretty long and because of the location. This place is more trendy than anything else.
603,3/29/2016,Arezu T.,dallas-2,4,"A family member took us tourists here to try Steel City Pops because he really recommended it. It looked like a swanky popsicle place, very reminiscing of dessert places in Southern California where we live lol. It is a quaint little shop where you just  walk in and order what you want and they open the packaging for you and you grab the popsicle out yourself. I wanted something different and not so safe, so I asked the girl what she liked and she recommended the Pineapple and Jalapeño popsicle. I told her let's do this. It was pretty good! The pineapple tasted like real fruit and had the pulp of the pineapple which was awesome. The first bite is always sweet and then the jalapeños kick in after. It was super cold outside but we still decided to eat popsicles because we wouldn't get another chance to do it since we aren't from TX. They were around $3 a pop (haha) I believe. Glad we got to try it!"
604,6/18/2017,Juan G.,dallas-2,2,Honestly not trying to bash this place just being legitimately completely honest the popsicle wasn't that amazing it's pretty generic tasting and I've had better at local Paleterias or Fruterías. It also seemed a little over priced as most paletas are way less and taste a lot better and more authentic. You can taste the love and authenticity in those paletas. All I tasted in Steel City Pops was the gentrification.

Updated review",Karen L.,dallas-2,5,"I've been back here over and over again, and I love it! Coffee still reigns supreme. However, if you double fist it and take alternate bites of the Strawberry Cream and Vanilla Bean, it's heaven. You might look unsightly, but it's worth it.You probably also need a 3rd fistful of napkins since the ice cream can melt pretty quickly. And then maybe a 4th fist of a 4-pack bag of Popsicles to take home with you."
606,9/7/2015,Queenie T.,dallas-2,2,"Alright, I'm going to buck the trend here with a less than raving review.Steel City Pops has a lot of hype surrounding it. I have many friends who adore this place. Its whole premise is pretty darling--a shop dedicated to not ice cream, but popsicles. I have two issues with this: 1. my expectations were too high going in, and 2. like everyone else has mentioned, each popsicle is $3. If I had liked my popsicle, even considering those two things, this review would probably be on the other end of the spectrum.I didn't like mine at all.I had asked for a recommendation for a creamy popsicle, and one of the recommendations that I thought sounded good was the avocado popsicle, which supposedly had a hint of lime.I guess it's important to consider that because I grew up with Asian cuisine, I'm very used to avocado-based desserts. I can appreciate an avocado combined with some milk, a healthy dose of sugar, and a good amount of ice. I have a specific idea of what avocado things taste like, and I like the flavor that I know.This tasted nothing like that.The ""hint of lime"" was overpowering to where you couldn't taste any avocado at all. The texture was not as creamy as I had hoped, which was fine, but I was completely thrown off from the first taste. If this had been some sort of creamy lime popsicle, it would have been okay. But as an avocado popsicle, this needs to go back to the drawing board.Maybe I'll be back to try a different flavor, but I definitely would not go for the avocado."
607,7/9/2016,Jade N.,dallas-2,5,One of the best Popsicles I have ever had! They had a large variety of flavors and my goal is to try every single one of them! It's great to eat in the summer! I had the jasmine green tea one and it was amazing! The texture was perfect and don't even get me started on the flavor! I really recommend that flavor. The watermelon one was really good too! It's amazing how it's made of real fruits. It's always crowded here but I'm not surprised!
608,11/21/2015,ThomasLynn C.,dallas-2,5,"There should be a Steel City on every corner... Especially during the summer in Texas. They always have their standards and change up the flavors based on season too. There are fruity, creamy, sweet, and even spicy flavors. Every time we go, the staff are always smiling and very friendly. Sometimes they offer samples of various pops. Need coffee? They've got you covered for that too."
609,7/29/2016,Jason F.,dallas-2,5,I would highly recommend stopping in a getting a home made pop you can really connect with. Very friendly staff with a great selection and atmosphere. I really enjoyed the creamy and coconut pop! Makes you want to return again for the goodness!
610,4/17/2016,Jennie D.,dallas-2,4,"Definitely a cool concept to just have a Popsicle store. I got the pomegranate Popsicle and it tasted okay, a bit sour though. Kind of pricey for just a Popsicle but I understand that they make it themselves. They have different flavors everyday so make sure to check their website or call in advance to see what they have to offer that day! I would like to try the creamy Popsicles next time."
611,9/30/2015,Jonathan K.,dallas-2,5,"I'm not one to really follow the hype around the town, but man did this place live up to it. I came here after having dinner with my girlfriend and had pretty huge expectations due to the sheer hype! We were greeted instantly by the worker, she was extremely bubbly and informative! She really brightened up the place!My girlfriend and I both got the recommended choices which we're the Strawberry Lemonade and the Coffee pop. The coffee pop was extremely creamy and delicate and even had a coffee grind crust on the top to add a tiny crunch. It was the perfect little pop to settle the food we just had and priced quite reasonably at $3! Can't really complain! I really wish they would open up more locations because lower Greenville is quite a drive, but whenever I'm n the area, this is a must stop place for me! Can't wait to try out the other flavors!"
612,8/4/2014,Grace K.,dallas-2,5,"3 visits in 5 days.  I think that sums up my 5-star rating for Steel City Pops.  I am in LOVE with their pops, especially their cream pops.  I've tried both their fruity and creamy, but my favorite is the Strawberry Cream.  It is sooooooo deliciously creamy and strawberry-y!  If you're more of the fruity/non-creamy, go with the Strawberry or Sweet Tea.  Don't be inimidated by the line because it goes by real fast.  Unfortunately, in this weater, the pop also melts real fast.  Make sure you eat it in the store or grab a handful of napkins when eating it outside.  I have a few in the freezer, but I don't think I bought enough to last me one day.  Yikes! May have to come back to buy a 12 pack! :)"
613,5/31/2016,Grace L.,dallas-2,4,"Lives up to the hype! Yum!! Freshest, coolest, yummiest fruit popsicles we have ever bought. Only reason I am giving it not the full 5 stars is because thy are pricy and the wait can be long but the taste wow is legit :)  We would definitely go back! We went right after lunch at bbbop across the street and this ended our dinner perfectly before heading back home.  Bought the bag of pops to go. Wish it was in our city but that would be too dangerous :) would love to try all the flavors but loved our guava, strawberry cream and mango pops wow Great for summer !! Great fun location too for shopping and eating!!!"
614,7/16/2014,Sharde A.,dallas-2,3,"Perhaps Steel City Pops would have been better on a summer's day?  Still, there was quite a line during the nighttime so I figured they could just be that good.  Then after the first cold and painfully sugary bite of my non-hibiscus pop it dawned on me: the secret to fad success lies within the following formula,([something common] + [uncommon ingredient] + [all natural/organic/local/gluten free] + 2[market price]) * [YuppieFancyPants] = $$$An uncommon ingredient not found in the common Popsicle in this case would be chili, jalapeno, and hibiscus.  Then slap on a $3 price tag for each one (dude, I could use that $3 towards a box of already amazing Fudgsicles).  Then electrify that crap with yuppie magical powers, pick a location where you can be seen eating said transmogrified pop, and now you can really feel like a winner!""Oh yeah yeah such a great a concept, pom pom pom...""Enough amusing myself.  Yes, I think it's great they source locally when possible.  Okay, they sell Provid water where all of the proceeds go to Africa even though you can send money yourself (people like to get stuff in return, I know).  There are interesting flavors like Pineapple Jalapeno or Chocolate Chili which does have a nice kick to it.  Maybe I'm just not into pops like everyone else.  They're hard to eat and drip all over the place.  Water seems more refreshing to me then something cold, awfully sugary and $3.  Pat Baby really loved his vanilla bean pop and I just thought, ""Yeah it tastes ok but my pants aren't on the ground for it or anything like that"".Don't listen to me, I think I'm actually crazy for not being excited like everyone else.  Get ya' some Steel City Pop, in a 4 for $10 bag or 12 for $30 box for later, and enjoy the summer :)"
615,7/20/2016,Tiffany C.,dallas-2,5,"Never disappointed with the flavors when I come. I've only tried their mango, watermelon, and jasmine green tea flavors, but they were all so refreshing! Their fruit flavors are definitely more on the lighter, refreshing/cooling side, and their creamy flavors, like the jasmine green tea one, are really creamy and flavorful. If you take them home, they'll ask you how far you'll be going so they can pack them in a bag with an ice pack, which is a really nice offer. Wish there was more seating inside, but there's a lot of places in the area to sit."
616,6/27/2016,Mimi N.,dallas-2,5,"I absolutely love Steel City Pops. The variety of flavors are out of this world! You have the options of fruity flavors, creamy flavors, specialty flavors in addition to have your Popsicle dipped in chocolate. Once you enter the establishment, you can view the ice cream geniuses make the Popsicles. One of my favorite stops in Dallas. Get the avocado lime, coffee, lavender lemonade...or just get all of them."
617,7/7/2014,Trinh T.,dallas-2,4,"Steel City Pops is a gourmet/fancy/high end dessert shop that serves up some delicious popsicles.  Actually forget trying to classify it.  Steel City Pops is cool.  The popsicles are cold.  And if you come here you're in for an amazing treat.My Overall Rating - 4  1/2 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)Atmosphere - Steel City Pops has an amazing atmosphere.  First off, it's in a pedestrian friendly area of lower Greenville.  There's plenty of outdoor seating that's shaded & lined with Christmas lights that gives off a backyard feel.  Also, if it's after dinner time, expect a line out the door.  The good news is that they move fast.  The bad news is parking on Lower Greenville.  Not really their problem but it might be yours.  1 Star.Service - Like I said, the staff is super-fast.  A board displays the flavors of the day, which are classified between Fruity & Creamy.  Once you select your pop(s), they'll conveniently cut the plastic so you can easily pull it out.  The two most important attributes for a popular place are here:  Fast & Friendly.  1 Star.Food - Ok, let's get the obvious thing out the way.  You're not buying a mass produced, supermarket label popsicle.  These are custom made, hand dipped, & not cheap.  But it's worth it!  I like the creamy pops like Peanut Butter & Vanilla.  But if you want a little more variety try the fruity combinations like Strawberry Basil.  Now, my only minor nitpick is that I prefer the flavors at Hip Pop in Grapevine.  They're also less crowded & easier to get to while having similar offerings.  But Steel City Pops has amazing atmosphere & flavors to satisfy anyone.  2 Stars.Will I Return? - When I can find a parking space.  If you live in or around Dallas, Steel City Pops is a MUST visit.  The pops & staff are great and you're only limitation may be parking.  For me, I still think I would rather hit Hip Pop in Grapevine only because it's more accessible, but that's a personal preference based on location, not based on product.  Steel City Pops is as good as it gets.   1/2 Star.My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score."
618,7/6/2014,Cat N.,dallas-2,4,"By now I have had three coconut, one pineapple jalapeño, one hibiscus, and one watermelon. They were all good and flavorful but I gotta say, my favorite is coconut. It was my first choice and I've tried other flavors. But I always go back to coconut. Never forget your first *winks* ahha jk! Its not just coconut cream, there's also coconut flakes on top and bottom of the popsicle. Each pop is three dollars. They offer a bag of four for $10 or if you want more, get a box. You don't have to settle for one flavor if you get the bag or box. Get a variety of flavors to try out! the pineapple jalapeños has a slight kick after taste because of the pepper. But nothing you can't handle. It's for those who don't like sweets. I've tried both creamy and fruity so I must say, I'm a creamy popsicle girl. It's a nice treat to have in Texas heat! Oh and if you have your dog with you on a walk, you are allowed to bring your pets in to get a pop! Don't leave your dog in the hot car!"
619,7/7/2015,Irene Y.,dallas-2,4,"While Steel City Pops Dallas originated in Alabama, this award winning all natural, healthy dessert option is a welcomed addition to cowboy country. On my visit the line was out the door on a random Thursday night. But lets be honest, Dallas is home to hot and humid weather and while most people would want to stay indoors with the AC blasting paying an ice cold popsicle from this shop makes enduring the weather a bit more bearable - am I right? :)There are two types of popsicles - Fruity and Creamy. The menu even includes the calories next to all the flavors, which is informative for all those patrons counting calories. Psh... whatever, I just want something yummy!At the time, I wanted something more refreshing so I went with the blood orange on the Fruity side as it was an uncommon flavor and my boyfriend tried the Strawberry Cream on the Creamy both. Both were tasty, but I felt that the Creamy treats have a much more dynamic flavor, whereas the Fruity is more subtle and light. On a future visit I plan to try to Avocado on the Creamy side - mmm..."
620,7/23/2014,Paul H.,dallas-2,5,"Excellent location across from Trader Joe's. The small lobby can get very cramped during rush hour. I suggest enjoying the pops inside. Once you step outside, it melts super quick in the Texas heat. I've had the Hibiscus, Pineapple Jalapeno, Coffee, Coconut, Vanilla Bean and Sweet Tea. All were delicious. The 'Fruity' flavors are more ice-like while the 'Creamy' flavors have a thicker consistency. At 2.77 each, the price is right. I don't understand their gift cards however. The gift cards cost more than paying for the pops out right. Example: 12 pops for $30 or $30 Gift Card for $30.42 Gift Card."
621,11/21/2015,Preeya B.,dallas-2,4,"So apparently steel city pops made popsicles cool again. I guess I'm 6 years old again? According to my friend, this is one of the most trendy spots to go in Dallas. And my friend who lives in Dallas insisted on taking me here. They have two popsicle types: fruity and creamy, both for $3. According to her, the creamy popsicles are what make this place awesome. I decided to go fruity and ordered the cinnamon apple popsicle in keeping with the fall season. It was good, and obviously made a fresh. However, it wasn't spectacular. If I ever come back I will definitely try a creamy popsicle or try a more unique flavor. The interior is tiny, but there is plenty of seating outside. And considering this is a great way to cool off in the heat being outside isn't too bad (unless it's 90+ degrees out, I suppose).The parking lot is a complete mess. The spots are very tiny and consider yourself lucky if you find a spot. You may need to drive around to other lots or find parking at Trader Joe's/Walmart/on the nearby streets. Good luck."
622,3/12/2016,Carrie L.,dallas-2,5,"I've been here so many times and I don't even live in Dallas.  So unfortunately I lost count of all the flavors I've tried, but their creamy flavor is usually better than the fruity flavor (imo).  Although their fruity flavors are usually more creative!  I also noticed the menu does change quite a bit so it's not the same old every time you visit.  I call this the hipster ice cream place.  I love it!"
623,8/6/2015,Alex C.,dallas-2,5,"Short line, reasonable prices, tasty popsicle.  Strawberry lemonade tasted like they just froze some homemade strawberry lemonade.  Super yum.Parking sucks, like everything on Lower Greenville has for the last ten years.  We got yelled at by the Walgreens security guard cop guy.Definitely not a place to linger in - very small lobby.  Great starting point for an afternoon walk though!"
624,6/26/2016,Amanda N.,dallas-2,5,So Steel City Pops came to Klyde Warren Park for this Good Friday celebration thing and I happened to stop by the park during a trip to Dallas with my student org. Apparently my Dallas friends said they were popular here so I had to try it out. I got the hibiscus pop not really knowing what hibiscus was... I heard it was a flower and was kinda scared but the pop looked really pretty so I got it anyways. It was honestly so refreshing and the flavor was poppin (ya poppin pop lol). I had a bite of my friend's vanilla pop and you can definitely tell the quality of a place by their vanilla. They definitely didn't just use extracts and stuff and used fresh ingredients for their pops. $3 for one can be a little pricey but it was really good and totally worth it.
625,6/25/2015,Angela H.,dallas-2,4,"Steel City Popped my Cherry with Guava.   Cute set up.  The patio is inviting,  the line is not ha ha.  Maybe a double door idea or a rope line.  Great idea for a business, the solution for crowds isneeded.  Bc it is hot out.   Actually I think my popsicle and my heart melted at the same time,  more because of my company, not the stroll on Greenville. I love the way my popsicle was presented to me.  Opened at one end and I just had to retrieve it from the plastic with out effort,  just a smile.   My mouth was cold,  my hands sticky,  my heart pounding,  my eyes following.  All the ingredients listed on the board, external, and internal haha, were flavors fitting in a perfect match on a sunny day,  blended with 2 sets of gorgeous legs holding sticks that set the tone for happiness.  I will work my way through most of them.  I think I am more of a fruit pop than a creamy pop kind of girl.  That is what I tell ppl anyway."
626,9/15/2014,Rachel R.,dallas-2,5,I came here today for the first time with one of my girlfriends. She had been here before and couldn't believe that I had never been! I am so glad that she introduced me to this cute little shop. My friend went for the avocado lime popsicle and I opted for the coffee popsicle. They were both part of the creamy section of popsicles. DELISH. Mine had some coffee grinds on the end of it which added to the intense coffee flavor. My friend loved the avocado lime. This is not the last time I will be back!
627,10/24/2015,Arpita B.,dallas-2,5,"For a person who hates Pops... Steel pops was a turning point in my life. I admit...I was a reluctant customer who gave into peer pressure to try this place. I couldn't figure out why people were coming to this place in hoards & leaving with a blissful smile & a ice pop in hand! I mean... it's an ice pop after all!! I couldn't be more wrong!I decided to try the butter pecan flavor!  Omg! I can't even begin to describe how yummy it was! The creamy, buttery, richness melts into this wonderfulness.... The ends result: a blissful smile & satiated taste buds just coz of one steel ice pops!You have yourself a fan! Will definitely be back to try some more of the flavors!"
628,4/30/2016,Markus N.,dallas-2,5,"400+ reviews can't be wrong. Here's what you need to know:1. Best Popsicle you'll ever have. Especially the cookie Popsicles (it's a cookie in the middle) and yes the cookie is gluten-free. 2. Prices are super reasonable. 3. The line will be out the door or longer. 4. Unless you go at non-peak times, parking is insane. Saying all that to say GO HERE."
629,9/7/2015,Kathlena H.,dallas-2,4,"I've seen pictures of this place and have been wanting to try it for quite sometime. This is such a great idea to beat the heat! There is such a wide assortment of flavors, I'm pretty sure the poor girl in front of me was having indecisive issues and stood there for a good five minutes deciding! I decided to go with a creamy coconut pop. I am so glad I did! There were flakes of real coconut and the flavor was rich and delish! It did melt pretty fast in the heat so I would recommend staying put inside or under the shade outside until you finish. At $3 it's reasonably priced as well."
630,1/30/2017,Sarah Anna H.,dallas-2,5,"We love this place, they have the best popsicles ever! Always new seasonal flavors, this past holiday flavors were amazing! We will be back soon!"
631,11/5/2015,Nazia H.,dallas-2,5,"Where to begin? This has become an almost weekly tradition (before the weather started turning cold)! Always a go-to to take out-of-towners! Line out the door, down the street? No worries, it is FAST moving so you'll be in and out in no time. Favorite flavors: lime, watermelon, passionfruit, coffee, and good ol' chocolate. The flavors rotate and change and they add new ones seasonally!"
632,8/4/2015,Emily S.,dallas-2,4,"This place has become one of my favorites and is a really great alternative to my usual froyo or ice cream indulgences. It is located in the trendy Lower Greenville area, and I try to make it a point to stop here after a dinner at one of the many restaurants on this road.NOTE - it is ALWAYS crowded and the line can get very long, which can be pretty miserable in the Texas heat. They could use more room inside and since space is limited, these lines usually keep you outdoors for a while. With that said, the lines do move fast and you will be enjoying your Popsicle in no time. They have two options - Fruity or Creamy which are very different! The fruity pops are what you would expect from a Popsicle and are water based. They use all natural ingredients and have a lot of cool crazy flavors. They are always switching out the flavors and coming up with new ones.The creamy side (my personal fave) are more like an ice cream pop. They have flavors like vanilla, chocolate, coconut and coffee. They are so creamy, sweet, and truly the best.The real game changer though is their cookie pops! Seriously my favorite thing on their menu and the real reason I keep coming back. These are creamy pops with either cookie, brownie, or shortcake in the middle. AMAZZINGG!! My favorites are the coffee brownie and the strawberry shortcake. FYI - these pops are a little more expensive, but wayyy worth it!"
633,11/4/2015,Leslie P.,dallas-2,4,"The first time I came here, I decided on the vanilla chocolate chip popsicle. It was creamy, and the cookie was great. It tasted as if I dunked the cookie in a glass of cold milk. It was so good that I came back the very next day to try the banana pudding cookie popsicle. It didn't have as much banana flavor as I was hoping. It would've been awesome if there were banana chunks too!The guy who was working the second day was nice, and let me in 5 minutes before they were officially opened."
634,9/23/2015,Edmund F.,dallas-2,4,"Scratch-made popsicles + Texas heat = winnerThis place is located on Greenville Avenue within walking distance from many great restaurants.  I'd recommend stopping by afterwards for a cool treat to cool off. Don't let a long line discourage you as it typically disappears within a few minutes.  Most recently I had their pina colada.  It was creamy but not overly heavy, sweet and fruity with a touch of acid.  While on my last visit they had plenty of non-creamy flavors to choose from,  there just weren't quite as many creamy-fruit options to pick from.  I had my heart set on strawberries and cream only to find it unlisted."
635,6/10/2014,Victoria T.,dallas-2,5,"Love this place!!!! It's in such a prime location on Greenville. I went here with my friend after we ate lunch at HG Sply Co. The logo is super cool and I love how there is seating right outside. Seeing all the families enjoy their pops made me really excited to get mine!!!When you walk in, there is a large chalkboard menu and there are two columns of flavors! Fruity or Creamy. I ordered the Cherry Sour Cream and my friend ordered the Chocolate Chili! Both were great!!! The Chocolate Chili had a nice kick and the Cherry was delicious and creamy! The nice cashier told me that one was her favorite and I can totally see why!You also have the option of buying pops in a box of 4 or 12! I also saw a flyer that they do events as well! I think my favorite thing about Steel City is that their pops are all gluten free, all natural, and made fresh!!! They also have a sign that says if you don't enjoy your pop, you can try another one for free! Now that is customer service!I can't wait to go back and try out the rest of the flavors! You definitely won't regret coming here!!!!!"
636,6/13/2014,Peter H.,dallas-2,3,"How can a popsicle claim to be gluten free when gluten is only found in grain and wheat?Anywho, My buddies and I decided to try out the pops due to the large crowd it had standing outside enjoying their posicles.  I opted for the avocado pop which is made up of avocado, lime juice, sugar, and water.  I wasn't expecting the lime to be the dominant flavor in the pop, rather something similar to Vietnamese style avocado smoothies.  Either way, the pop was refreshing and creamy due to the bright lime flavor mixed with the creaminess of the avocado.Honestly, a pop is 3 dollars, unless you purchase it in bulk.  Although the pop was tasty, i would rather go to a mexican paleta store to get the same pops at a fraction of the cost."
637,5/24/2014,Stephen K.,dallas-2,5,"These aren't your old fashioned icy popsicles that were so cold from spending eight months in your parents' freezer that they had that little white permafrost all over them. They were frozen solid like a polar ice core sample and there was no way you could get them to melt without flamethrowering them for 20 minutes. Then when they finally did melt they would break in half and part would fall off the stick on the ground. Sonofabitch! My first bite of pineapple jalapeno at SCP was perfectly soft and frozen at the same time. Although it was from the fruit side of the menu, this one had a little creaminess which was perfect. And it brought plenty of spicy heat.  Deliciously done.The storefront was pretty and clean with very helpful servers, and you could tell that everyone was loving their tasty treats. Honestly, I was tempted to go straight back in and get another one...they were that good. Chocolate chili has my name on it for sure.And what a perfect location. Saturday night on Lower Greenville brought a steady crowd in search of dessert, and the atmosphere hearkened back to long-gone glory days of Greenville Ave back when I was a kid.I can guarantee that these pops won't spend eight months in anyones freezer: more like 8 minutes."
638,9/14/2014,Karen L.,dallas-2,4,"This is everything that it's cracked up to be! Hot summer days in Texas need Steel City Pops food truck edition! I came here a few times and tried a few flavors: Hibiscus, Sweet Tea, Avocado, Coffee, Strawberry, Jalapeno Pineapple, Peach, Blood Orange, and Lemon. My fave?? Hibiscus and Sweet Tea! :) They're a little pricey for a popsicle but genius-ly priced so that they're exactly $3 w/ tax. They have royalty cards so you can get one free (eventually)! Place is small, which means limited seating. You have a direct view into their kitchen and possibly watch them prep too. Parking's a little hard to find but mostly bc it's in lower greenville and parking is always limited. Def worth the stop though!"
639,7/29/2014,Kevin K.,dallas-2,5,I really like this place! The pops are really good and taste like nothing else out there.  The creamy pops are really rich so its like an icecream pop.Here's what I got.Coffee (favorite)Peach (bit sweet)Blood orange Sweet tea HibiscusAll were really good! Definitely recommend.
640,4/2/2016,Lily W.,dallas-2,5,"I've tried the strawberry pop which tasted good but not better than any other places I've tried. But, when I tried the vanilla chocolate chip cookie pop, this was a game changer. It was amazing and different to which I don't think I've had anything similar before. The only flaw is how fast they can melt even though I was sitting in the shade (must be the typical Texas heat). The line can get long and the store packed with people, but the service is quick. My sister got the avacado pop which somewhat tasted like lime so she didn't like it. Because she only took like two bites, I told her she didn't have to eat the rest and I would buy her another flavor. The friendly worker however gave her a new one in replace."
641,7/28/2014,Shauna T.,dallas-2,5,"Visited here with Aaron L. twice and it was fantastic! Customer service is super friendly and there's a popsicle flavor for every person. I love how the popsicles contain real pieces of fruit or true and honest ingredients. If you take a peek in the back, you can see a few employees hand making the popsicles. I've only tried a handful of the flavors, but the peach is probably my favorite. Actual chunks of peach rines that make me know that I'm not eating artifical food coloring. Parking is a bit of a pain. If you aren't lucky to get a parallel spot in the front, swing around the back for a small lot. During peak hours, it's almost impossible to find a spot. However, it's well worth your time and there's also a nice Trader Joe's across the street! Always anticipate to wait about 10-15 minutes in line; Steel City Pops is super popular at all times of the day!"
642,11/26/2016,Josh S.,dallas-2,5,"Tasty gourmet popsicles in a wide variety of staple flavors and a few on seasonal rotation. Flavors are milk and water based, with the fruit pops containing chunks of real fruit. The back area has a viewing area where you can occasionally see the pops being made. There can be a line during the bust times, and parking may be valet only as well unless you are willing to walk from the nearby residential neighborhood. Highly recommended."
643,10/10/2016,Linda L.,dallas-2,4,Had the strawberry lemonade popsicle and it was very delicious!! Decent priced too. Would def come back again and again.
644,7/3/2015,Wendy T.,dallas-2,4,"Creamy and smooth, or fruity and tart!  Both delicious choices, and there are even Cookie Pops with real brownie or cookie bits mixed in :)Calories listed for the health conscious :DAll $3 with the tax included~  Kind of pricy for a pop, but fun to try (and delish)!"
645,6/13/2015,Liz T.,dallas-2,5,"Yes. Just yes! This place is such a fun, different treat. It is perfect on a summer day. We tried to go on Friday night but the line was way out the door. We went on Saturday afternoon and there was barely a line. They were very efficient. I had the strawberry lemonade Popsicle and it was SO good!! My boyfriend had the chocolate brownie Popsicle and his was also tasty. You are sure to enjoy one of their flavors on a hot day!"
646,8/10/2014,Anitha K.,dallas-2,4,"This place impressed me. I didn't think a popsicle could be anything better than what we all ate as little kids but I was wrong. So far I've tried hibiscus, blood orange and sweet tea. All were great but I really enjoyed hibiscus!! The line gets long but service is quick so try it! It's $3 which seems like a lot but makes sense because of the quality and flavor.I'll be back to try the cream flavors. Just what you need on a summer day in Dallas."
647,6/29/2016,Sarah S.,dallas-2,5,Yum! This place is amazingly yummy. It's clean and the service is friendly. My kids ate it up....literally! I give this place two sticky thumbs up. The mango pop is to die for.
648,6/6/2014,Sherene A.,dallas-2,5,"When was the last time you heard the word ""tardy"" used in a sentence?How about this one: ""Cutting."" When was the last time you heard someone say....""cutting"" in reference to standing in a line?Before yesterday, I couldn't remember the exact memory of the last time I heard those words being used in a sentence...but I know it had to have been in high school. WELL...it's summer folks! And guess who is populating the front of Steel City Pops? EVERY single high schooler in a 15 mile radius, that's who!I was standing in line pondering what I was going to choose (pineapple jalapeno, blueberry basil or avocado...I ended up getting one of each)...when I felt a tap on my shoulder and a young girl said...""I know what I want...can I cut in front of you?""I almost passed out. Whatever. About the popsicles---they're amazing. They're frozen in such a way that a liquid pop takes 15 min to freeze in their bad ass freezers...so it's solid but still creamy on the inside. And they are....""steal one from a baby"" good. Dallas...I am jealous of you. I WISH that Austin had a place like you! (one of the guys there took me and my friends on a tour of the facilities. :) VERY clean back there.)Even though this little shop replaced a long time Dallas staple on the Lower Greenville scene -- RIP Zubar --I have to give it credit....it's perfect."
649,12/1/2016,Sarah A.,dallas-2,5,Oh my gosh these are amazing.  They are completely reasonable in price and service was great.  Server recommended I try the buttermilk and it was INCREDIBLE.  Peppermint was also tasty.  I will be back
650,5/9/2015,Solji J.,dallas-2,4,"I had heard a lot about Steel City Pops and finally got a chance to try it out for myself. First, the interior is modern, hip, and very Dallas. Great place to bring tourists!I got a coffee brownie cookie pop. It was worth the $4.50. There is a brownie in the creamy coffee pop. It wasn't too hard to bite, and the ice cream was good. I tried the vanilla chocolate chip and that's what I'll be getting next time!Definitely get a creamy or cookie pop. I tried a couple of my friends' fruity pops and felt that they were a bit too ""icy"" to really enjoy. The cookie pops are $$$ but if you're already dropping $3 on a creamy pop, might as well upgrade to the cookie pop. I will be back sometime, but it just probably won't be a regular thing! #brokecollegestudent"
651,1/4/2016,Jennifer Y.,dallas-2,5,"We tried coffee, iced tea, and buttermilk. Iced tea was ok. Coffee and buttermilk were heavenly. The parking can get tricky in the area but it's worth it. Prices are not cheap for these suckers but still ... worth it! I do wish the employees were a little more attentive and less gossipy with their friends but I guess that should be expected from a crowd of kids running a hip place. :o/  Oh well .. I still can't wait to stop by here again on my next visit to Dallas to see my fam!"
652,6/21/2015,Jessica P.,dallas-2,3,"Finally came by to see what all the fuss was about!A great place to get a treat on a hot day. I had the watermelon pop and my date had the guava, both were pretty good. However, I don't think they were amazing - maybe their specialty is the cream pops? Location is great, you can always come by, grab a pop then take a stroll. This place is really selling more of an experience rather than a pop, saying that based off what I tasted. Definitely stop by if you're in the area but wouldn't go out of my way for it - will try something else next time and update my review."
653,8/18/2014,Michelle H.,dallas-2,3,"Wanted to check out what the hype was all about.  Long lines, but it goes quickly.  Tried the coconut (my fav--creamy coconut flavor), coffee (pretty good), and blood orange (eh, tastes like any orange popsicle).  They had flavors like avocado, peach, strawberry, sweet tea, watermelon, pineapple jalapeno, hibiscus, vanilla, lemon, chocolate--think they have different flavors too.  I liked my coconut popsicle and the sweet tea sounds like what I want to try next, but I personally would not stand in a long line for this again---or even drive all the way to this side of town for a ~$3 stick of ice cream.  I guess I didn't see the hype.  I would prefer a Sprinkles cupcake (but then again some people don't see that hype either).  Personal preference, I guess."
654,6/15/2016,Jennifer L.,dallas-2,4,"On a hot day these are a welcome treat. After a good food truck experience this was the perfect dessert. Maybe it was that the pop had been talked up quite a bit, my Pinā colada pop was good, but not mind blowing like I was told it would be. Three dollars a piece I think it is a fair price for these pops."
655,9/16/2014,Mindy T.,dallas-2,4,I was soooooooooo disappointed they were out of the Avocado flavor!  But I tried the Hibiscus one instead and it was pretty good.They have lots of flavors from fruity to creamy.  Delicious!My friends' had the caramel and the strawberry.  The Hibiscus one was fruity and light.  The strawberry one tasted like fresh strawberries.  And the caramel was so creamy and indulgent.  Would highly recommend.  Perfect for the summer or a night cap after dinner.
656,8/7/2016,Brittany C.,dallas-2,5,"Steel City Pops is probably my favorite place to grab dessert in Dallas. The new chocolate chip cookie ice cream blew my mind tonight, plus they have several other flavors that knock it out of the park every time. I have yet to be disappointed! Strawberry is incredible, full of flavor and real strawberry seeds. Chocolate is perfection & coconut is one of my favorites.  Try them all."
657,7/19/2015,Jaki S.,dallas-2,5,If you've never been here you are missing out on a treat. My favorites are the passion fruit and the avocado. Sooooo good!
658,5/29/2015,Ravi C.,dallas-2,5,"CRACK ON ICE!!!one just is not enough. After having one for the first i time instantly wanted to have another. I had the blood orange(amazeballs!!) and wife had the cucumber(lime?) does it even matter, honestly?!?!I want to try EVERY flavor they offer. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE."

Updated review",Kelsey R.,dallas-2,5,"This place is still one of my favorite places in Dallas. We had them come out to my work to cater an event and the vendor was early and so polite! Even though it was a very hot day, he had no complaints, and was super friendly to all of our employees. He even stepped in to be a backup umpire in our kickball game when we had some questionable calls from our partisan ref. Always delicious, never had a bad pop yet. I still bring all my friends to introduce them!"
660,10/12/2016,Mitsi P.,dallas-2,4,"Yummo! Green tea, orange, mint. I would keep going even in the dead of winter."
661,8/15/2016,Nancy K.,dallas-2,5,"Horchata is my fav!! So good. Plus the staff is super friendly and cute! Pops are $3.00 and there's a flavor for everyone ranging from fruity to creamy. I went during August, so be careful because it melts pretty fast :( so grab some napkins! All in all, I think steel city definitely lived up to the hype!"
662,1/23/2016,Anila A.,dallas-2,5,"Steel City Pops is simply amazing! Never knew popsicles could taste so good. I had their popsicles for the first time when Uber had their ice cream promotion going on and it was money will spent! Since then I've recommended these popsicles to just about everyone.Their fruity popsicles taste so fresh. I've had their mango, hibiscus, and strawberry lemonade. Normally popsicles just taste like ice but not these. Their flavors are so rich!I've also had their coffee, chocolate, and vanilla bean. I think their creamy popsicles have a weird aftertaste that sticks to the roof of your mouth for a little bit but that doesn't stop me from getting them!Only $3/popsicle and they have a loyalty card where every 11th popsicle is free."
663,8/18/2016,Robert B.,dallas-2,3,"I had the carmel. It was good, but at $3 a pop it better be. I'm also the kind of guy who don't give a $%^ that they are gluten free and organic though."
664,10/12/2016,Nader H.,dallas-2,5,"Cheap, delicious, and hip, what more can you ask for? Such a delicious variety of popsicles, I love coming here on a hot day!"
665,8/16/2016,Sapna B.,dallas-2,5,"How could anyone rate popsicles lower than 5 and especially Steel City Pops.  Definitely try the flavors you wouldn't imagine would be a flavor.  Avocado, pineapple jalapeño, orange mint green tea, horchata, oops I have too many favorites.  You may purchase one but walk out with an awesomely packed bag of a few pops."
666,1/19/2015,Keli B.,dallas-2,4,"Here are some quick notes:Steel City Pops is a great spot to stop while walking around the Lower Greenville area of Dallas. It is across from Trader Joes.Parking: There is a lot behind the row of buildings as well as street parking.Product: So far I have tried the vanilla bean, hibiscus, blueberry cream, and avocado. All were delicious and refreshing. The pops have a lot of flavor. You can also have any of them dipped in chocolate. Yum!Service: Great! There is usually a line, but it moves fast. Suggestion: Grab an assortment for your next dinner party or barbecue. Your guests will love having such a unique dessert!"
667,3/30/2015,Rosanna L.,dallas-2,5,"If you can get over the cost of a single popsicles then you'll have no issue finding the perfect flavor to satisfy your taste buds. Steel City Pops popsicles has to be the best popsicle I've ever had even better than the one from the Mexican ice cream carts we get in the city of Chicago, yep, I said it, it's better than the paleta. I automatically went for the coconut because it's my all time favorite and the creaminess and milkiness of the popsicle was delicious! This is the perfect treat for that hot summer days, yum."
668,9/6/2016,YelpmeRhonda O.,dallas-2,5,"Pricey, parking is terrible, tiny store packed with people just standing around IN THE WAY eating their popsicles. For Pete's sake, there is a nice little seating area right outside - move out and let others get inside to order. Yet I still give this place 5 stars because the employees were super-friendly and that was one yummy popsicle."
669,5/12/2015,Farheen I.,dallas-2,5,"Popsicles are the new macarons, which were the new cakeballs, which were the new cupcakes. This place is awesome. I really love their creamy frozen treats, my favorite is the vanilla cookie pops. Oh. my. god. That has got to be the most delicious popsicle I have ever eaten. I love that they use real vanilla bean, it makes all the difference. The cookie center is placed so that you get a piece of cookie in every bite. So, this concept comes from the Mexican paletas, but Steel City pops are more creamy and sweeter. It is much more dense than the traditional American popsicle and Steel City has adopted the concept for more mainstream tastes.  Also, each pop will run you around $3-4, which is usually more expensive than paletas. They are definitely worth it as a treat! If you are in the area, check them out."
670,11/22/2015,Donna Y.,dallas-2,5,Delicious! I ordered a pomegranate Popsicle for $3 and it was amazing! They have so many flavors and it changes based on the season. I wish i had one closer to where I live but if I'm in the area again I'll be back!
671,9/1/2016,Myesha E.,dallas-2,5,I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I've only had the strawberry lemonade and the coconut cream. I want to try more flavors but every time I ago...I always grab the coconut cream...One day hopefully I'll be able to try out all the other flavors.  Steel city pops PLEASE come to the bishop arts!!!
672,6/7/2016,Amy Y.,dallas-2,4,Great place with wide assortment of popsicle flavors! Loved how they split with fruity and creamy. I was feeling a creamy and exotic popsicle when I visited so tried out the chai latte. Still a bigger fan of the hot beverage version but quite impressed how well the flavor was executed! Definitely a creamy and surprisingly juicy popsicle. Perfect spot for a late summer night!
673,2/23/2016,Jennifer H.,dallas-2,4,I've been here a couple of times and was not impressed.... Until I got the cookies and cream cookie pop! My view definitely changed after that. You do have to pay a little extra ($4.50/each cookie pop) but I think it's worth it! Its so creamy and delicious. You are literally eating a cookie with ice cream. YUM.The fruity pops are a little too fruity and watery for me. The creamy pops are much better in my opinion. Avocado is suprisingly really good. Coffee seems to be a favorite among my friends but I thought it was a little too bitter. Lemon cookie pop was not as good as the cookies and cream. I've also heard strawberry is to die for... But it's only available during the season.
674,9/23/2016,Pierre G.,dallas-2,5,Great ice cream pops they are quick easy and ready . Line go's by quick pay out is easy.  I had the root beer pop was very good I will definitely come back with a date after dinner.
675,11/24/2015,Talar T.,dallas-2,5,"I was visiting a friend in Dallas and she said I had to try steel city pops. I tried the vanilla chocolate chip cookie pop and I was obsessed! We went back the next day, I tried the pomegranate flavor, it was so refreshing! Before I came back to LA I had to go back one last time, and once again I got the cookie pop. If I visit Dallas again, the first thing I will probably do is go to steel city pops! The only downside is that if you go later in the day, they might be out of the very popular flavors. But overall 5 stars!"
676,5/28/2015,Ria G.,dallas-2,4,"Oh my god...yum! Had blood orange(fruity), caramel, and chocolate(creamy) one after another...must admit, I liked creamy ones better...grandma liked blood orange better. So its about  personal preferences.But they all taste goooood! Clean and simple taste with few, quality ingredients.A winner for me!One star less for the price AND price-chart complexity. I couldn't understand the pricing at all. Paid $20 for 6. Whereas my calculations estimated $17($11 for 4 pack and $3 each for other two, incl. tax). Oh well!"
677,8/19/2016,Amy W.,dallas-2,5,Yum! We are in town visiting friends and they took us here for Popsicles. I had the vanilla chocolate chip cookie pop - amazing! It's vanilla ice cream and actual chocolate chip tasted like cookie dough heaven. It was pretty soft and melted fast but they gave me a cup to catch what was melting. Apparently the fruit Popsicles hold together better but the cookie pop hit the spot!
678,5/20/2015,Jen V.,dallas-2,5,Can't. Get. Enough.I feel like I can't go to lower Greenville and not stop.I've had the chocolate chip and brownie and both so good.  Always a little line just confirming of how good it is.
679,7/1/2016,Audrey A.,dallas-2,5,YUM YUM YUM! Hubby and I had SCP for the first time. We will be coming back. Cantaloupe & Watermelon. Both so yummo.
680,2/3/2016,Kelly W.,dallas-2,5,"I stopped by steel city pops based on a friend's recommendation. We tried the pineapple jalapeño, raspberry lemon & strawberry lemonade. The raspberry lemon is more tart than strawberry lemonade, but neither are too sour. The pineapple jalapeño is yummy with a slight kick."
681,5/31/2015,Shannon L.,dallas-2,4,"Yum!! This place is pretty good. This city has definitely been lacking variety in its frozen dessert options, and Steel City Pops is pretty unique! I've been here twice now, and have enjoyed the Strawberries & Cream and Buttermilk flavors. The buttermilk was super creamy and tasted a bit like plain greek yogurt. However, I think the strawberry popsicle had better texture. The buttermilk was a little too soft for me, and melted quickly. Each of these popsicles was $3, which was more reasonable than what I was expecting (but still kind of a rip for one popsicle, I guess haha).The interior is sleek and urban, befitting the name, but a little small. A long line easily spills out of the door. Fortunately, there is plenty of covered outdoor seating!It's a nice place to take someone who wants to know the less strip mall/chain restaurant-dominated Dallas. It's a bit out of the way (and not to DIE for or anything) for me to be coming all the time though.Don't bother with the parallel parking along the street. There's a large parking lot behind the Trader Joe's across the street. And don't forget to take a snap at that iconic ""Before I die"" wall!"
682,4/27/2015,Sarah H.,dallas-2,5,"I have such a sweet tooth, and this hits the spot!!! I'm SO upset we don't have one of these in Houston. I love dessert, and this is the perfect about of sweet without feeling crazy full. I can't say enough good things and I've only been there once. I got the Banana flavor, but they had so many different choices it was hard to choose. Next time I'm in Dallas, this is A MUST!!!! I would go there every weekend if I had the opportunity."
683,10/15/2015,Holly N.,dallas-2,4,"Avocado surprisingly just tastes like lime. I actually asked several friends to guess the flavor and they all guessed lime. I did enjoy the Hibiscus, Watermelon, and Coconut pops!"
684,12/29/2015,Matthew L.,dallas-2,4,"We came here after a late lunch on a weekday and they were pretty crowded which tells you about the place. The service was friendly. My friend got the mango pop. She really liked. I've personally had better mango pops at a Fruiteria stand. I wanted to get the blueberry cream but they ran out and were in the process of making new ones so I chose the chocolate instead. I've been here a couple times before and there's always been a flavor that I want that would be unavailable which is kind of annoying. The chocolate was good. It was very rich. Even though the pops were good, I would still say that it's still pricy. Also I'm not sure if it's the same with all the creamy pops but mine was substantially less than my friend's fruity pop. (See picture)"
685,8/8/2016,Za S.,dallas-2,4,"Pretty good pops. Just wish they will have the pineapple jalapeño available every day. I just have a hard time choosing a new flavor every single time. The change is definitely good but I mean I would at least like some pops to consistently stay on the menu "" pineapple jalapeño "". ;) I had the watermelon last night and it was pretty good. Also had the buttercream and lavender lemonade which were good also."
686,10/17/2014,Tuong Vi P.,dallas-2,3,"I am a huge fan of my own hometown's popsicle monarchs, with one of the founders graduating with his law degree from my very own alta mater, Georgia State University. Having tried more than 30 of their pops, I am quite particular about popsicles now. When I saw the Steel City Pops cart within Nasher Sculpture Center's premises for their monthly 'til Midnight at the Nasher, I ran as quickly as my little legs could permitted to grab a refreshing bar for the warm summer evening.I picked the peach one and unfortunately, I was massively underwhelmed. Having eaten KoP's wonderfully fresh and natural-tasting pop, I couldn't help but compare. While the pop was refreshing in that it was cold and juicy, It was overly sweet and truthfully did not have a prominent peach flavor. It tasted like an indiscernible fruit pop that was artificially sweetened.Nice service and if I see another one of these carts the next time I visit Dallas, I would give another pop a chance, seeing as how popular these summer treats are."
687,5/16/2016,Huy N.,dallas-2,4,"Been here a few times and I haven't really found that one flavor that sweeps me off my feet yet! The flavors (Brownie, Vanilla Chocolate Chip and Cherry Sour Cream) that I've had were good and I wouldn't mind coming back to Steel City Pops. I would like to try all of their flavors (each pop cost $3) until I find a favorite."
688,2/4/2016,Kaixi W.,dallas-2,5,"Totally worth the hype in my opinion. It has recently come to my attention that popsicles are now the next big frozen dessert (sorry froyo you had your wave of glory). Popsicle stands are everywhere and it would normally pain me to shell out $3 a pop for a popsicle when you can get a 6 pack of fruity goodness for the same price at the grocery store. However, Steel City Pops is like Gucci while those red white and blue rocket pops we all enjoyed as a kid is like Aeropostale. I think we all know what I mean by that statement.Although it can be very crowded in the store especially on a hot summer day in Texas, the handcrafted pops are worth it. The line goes by fast and the employee will even unwrap your pop (it comes wrapped in plastic) and hand it to you for immediate enjoyment. They're a bit small but the thickness makes up for it! I recommend any of the fruity flavors if you're looking to play it safe. Shop itself is busy at peak times - you will most likely bump into people and want to get out onto their cute patio/hangout spot in the front of the store asap. Bonus: the lower Greenville area is super cute to walk around especially on a date! I will definitely come back when i'm in Dallas again."
689,4/1/2015,Jean M.,dallas-2,4,"I've been here a few times and I tried the Strawberry cream and the coffee so far. The flavors are so rich and it  really tastes like what it is supposed to taste! And the price isn't that bad, $3 a pop. One thing is that these flavors probably won't be on the menu next time you come around, so get it if you want to order it. And I definitely recommend going here because the area is so nice and lively and their pops are delicious, which is the most important part:)"
690,9/4/2016,Melissa B.,dallas-2,5,One word - AMAZING! Our favorite was the vanilla chocolate chip. We also had the coconut and the was delicious too.
691,2/20/2017,Caitlin Y.,dallas-2,5,"Hubby and I stopped by here after a Saturday walk around White Rock Lake and a dinner on a patio. The whole neighborhood was buzzing. The parking lot around back was crowded, but we quickly found a spot. The line was out the door, and it moved quickly. Hubby had the Blood Orange pop while I had the Champagne White Tea pop. It was DELICIOUS!  The menu was broken up into Fruity Flavors and Creamy. There were also a few specialty options, like a creamy pop with cookie pieces, for example. Yummy. Would definitely return sometime we are in town!"
692,3/17/2017,Jim J.,dallas-2,1,"Cute idea, but our group of six tried all different combos. Not good. The ice cream is just not that good - milk chocolate and banana the WORST. Those two went in the trash. We won't be back."
693,8/31/2016,Nhu L.,dallas-2,4,"This is the first time I've tried this place. So excited. When I got here, it was 9.00 pm and there was a long line. But it doesn't take a long time to be able to order. We ordered and got our ice cream immediately. I got a Cookie and cream, it's okay, there was a lot of cookies. My boyfriend got the Caramel. Both of us like the caramel. But it's kind of pricey. It was 4.50$/each. It was great experience tho. I'll try the fruit pop next time."
694,6/1/2016,Orith L.,dallas-2,4,"Love the options! Amazing flavors! My favorites are the coconut and the Caramel. Worth the wait!!Perfect treat on a warm day, or any day..."
695,7/2/2015,Joy B.,dallas-2,5,"The long line of people outside with only 35mins til closing time didn't deter me from waiting and getting my pop! It's worth the wait!!!! The line goes by pretty quickly. (Besides, since it's in Lower Greenville, there's always good people watching to kill time.) I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of the flavors. I got the coffee brownie, strawberry lemonade, and buttermilk. I devoured the coffee brownie pop in 2 mins, pushing through my brain freeze. The buttermilk would not have been my first choice, but my boyfriend chose it...and I'm glad he did!!! This tasted like cream cheese had a baby with vanilla and butter.There's a few seats and a little standing room inside, but there's also a few seats outside. Go here after a nice dinner in lower Greenville, or before you grab some drinks!"
696,2/17/2016,BlueBleuBlu B.,dallas-2,5,"I love LOVE love LOVE this place. They are very creative with the flavors that they offer but most importantly the flavors are very yummy. Jalapeno Pineapple, Satsuma, and Raspberry Lemon. The flavor are very bold! Bring your cooler to take some home. There is a special for 4 for $11.00 and its worth EVERY penny!!This is not your average popsicle stand. It is for Foodies!"
697,8/28/2016,JaQuille C.,dallas-2,3,I've been wanting to come here for a while and I'm glad I finally got the chance to. I got there 10 minutes before they closed and the staff was still friendly and helpful even though they were about to close. The location is really nice and has a great atmosphere. I had the strawberry shortcake cookie pop and it was delicious. It tasted like fresh strawberries! I'll be back to try more flavors the next time I am in the area.
698,11/29/2015,Tim L.,dallas-2,4,"Can't go wrong with Steel City Pops! Great place to grab a popsicle after lunch or dinner. This place has two types of pops: fruity and creamery. They have a ton of regular flavors and also couple unique ones. The popsicles are refreshing and full of flavorful! Lines can get crazy but moves by fairly quick.At $3 a pop, you really can't go wrong with these! Definitely recommend this place especially during the summer when its scorching hot!"
699,8/29/2014,Julie P.,dallas-2,4,"I love this place! I am not a hard person to please when it comes to desserts but I think Steel City Pops may have just won me over from eating ice cream or gelato because I don't feel guilty eating these popsicles! I wonder how many calories are in each pop :PAnyways, there are so many flavors to choose from! I do want to try all of the flavors eventually, but some flavors do sound a little too weird for my taste hahahVanilla Bean- I love love love this flavor! I have nothing else to say, just try it for yourself :) Coffee- I feel like this is a lot of people's favorites. It is definitely one of my favorites, if you are looking for a safe choice, coffee is the way to go!Lemon- Not too lemony and perfect amount of sweet and creamyWatermelon- YUM! I usually like the creamy popsicles better but I think this one is my favorite fruity flavor Hibiscus- Interesting flowery fruity goodness.Strawberry- Nothing too special about this plain flavor, but it was good!Coconut- Not a fan, probably because I don't really like coconut, but all you coconut lovers, you should try it, because you'll probably love it.Peach- Sad to say, but I really didn't like the peach flavor... I don't know how to explain it, but it tasted kinda funkyAnyways, don't get turned off by the long line, it goes by really fast and it's worth it!"
700,9/21/2015,Daniel C.,dallas-2,3,"Way too much hype. If you think about it and really take away all the ""hipster"" trend out, you are literally paying for just a popsicle. Taste-wise, it's okay. I had the watermelon one? And the cashiers were raving about the flavor. I'm afraid much of the ""hype"" and the ridiculous line out the door does not justify the price tag and the wait. Go to Costco, pay 1/4 of the price and get yourself some equally good tasting popsicles at home."
701,3/25/2015,Maryam K.,dallas-2,5,"A very quaint shop cashing in on the nostalgia of eating popsicles on a hot summer day. They're definitely doing something right with their flavor combinations and presentation style. I tried the coffee brownie. This was a creamy coffee popsicle with a giant chunk of brownie at its core. It was delicious. One of the best popsicles I've ever had. The popsicles also don't melt too fast. This is a crucial element of popsicle judgment that determines how thoroughly you can enjoy the flavor without trying to catch every drip. Popsicles of friends: -cucumber lime (very refreshing, takes a bit to get accustomed to the flavor) -raspberry lemon (fruity, would get) The shop itself is quite small with very limited seating. There is standing room inside, but it can get crowded fast. Flavors also rotate so check beforehand if there is a specific flavor you want to try. Would recommend going outside if the weather is favorable. Street parking is available."
702,8/8/2014,Kat C.,dallas-2,5,"I am obsessed. I went five different days (four of them in a row, and even twice in one day) during the first week of my visit and bought eleven pops total. They must be making a killing because of people like me. But I am not ashamed and I only wish I could go more. Also a big thanks to my friends who helped feed this addiction by going so many times with me.There are two types of flavors, creamy - which seem like ice cream and fruity - which are more icy. Both have delicious flavors and are perfect for these hot Texas summer days. I've gotten ones from both columns and though I like some more than others, all have been good. My personal favorite is the blood orange. You can get a mix-and-match 4 pack which comes with this pretty nifty insulated bag and they'll even give you an ice pack if you're traveling a little further. It's $3 for one or about $11 for the 4 pack and the menu of flavors doesn't always stay the same. There are also days when some flavors are sold out. They have a couple of seats inside in three sections to hang out with a few friends and some benches to sit outside as well. Most times I've been here, there's been a bit of a wait but the line moves fairly quickly and the workers are friendly and efficient. I was standing behind a friend who was visiting from out of town and mouthed to one of the workers that I was going to pay for him. She automatically got it and was onboard and even helped me convince the other worker when we ended up at her register instead. Thanks!Best of all, they're dog friendly! But not parking friendly."
703,11/6/2015,Sabrina B.,dallas-2,5,"Friends took me here for a birthday dessert and omg, these pops are to die for. I got the butter pecan and it was rich, creamy and oh so delicious. A really special treat as I don't have a place like this where I'm from. If you get the opportunity to go here, do it. You will not regret it."
704,8/17/2015,Mykie D.,dallas-2,5,Delicious homemade popsicles made with fresh and natural ingredients. I got the strawberry lemonade and it was amazing. They have so many varieties to choose from. Perfect for a hot Texas day.
705,9/19/2015,Samiksha O.,dallas-2,5,I really wish I lived closer to a steel city pops because it's delicious and the whole ambiance is chill. It's located around different bars in Greenville so I can really see myself going here before bar hopping. I got the strawberry lemonade Popsicle and it was so good! It's fresh and I could taste both of the fruits really well.
706,9/5/2014,Natalie T.,dallas-2,4,Tried a mango and an avocado-lime popsicle! At first I thought the avocado would be heavy and creamy but it had a sweet and sour hint of lime juice which paired so well with the avocado! The mango tasted like it grew off a tree. It wasn't too sweet or sour and most of my friends chose this flavor. What a sweet treat :)
707,4/4/2015,Nick K.,dallas-2,4,"Very tasty.  Great variety of 'pops'.  The staff were very friendly.I tried he Passion Fruit - it had a great flavor and a refreshing texture.  Other family members had similar feedback.There are fruity and creamy types available.  The store has the calories listed for each pop.Will drop by again , when we are in the area."
708,10/1/2015,Carmela D.,dallas-2,4,"We first tried these pops at a bridal event.  Then when we happened to be on Greenville Ave. again I HAD to stop in for another refreshing pop!  The flavors are unique and I love that the calorie content is posted next to each flavor.  So far I've had the Strawberry Lemonade and the Coffee flavors and both were delicious! Apparently Coffee is only a summer flavor which was a bummer to find out but I'm comforted by the knowledge that all their other flavors are equally as amazing.  The pops are reasonably priced and even though the line was out the door when I got there, it moved quickly.  Definitely worth a stop if you're in the neighborhood."
709,8/27/2015,Brian G.,dallas-2,4,"When it's 99 degrees and you're seeking respite, Steel City Pops may offer some solace in its popsicles.  The pops are pre-made so it's easy to pick one out and get on your way.  I tried the coffee pop, which was delicious.  A tad too creamy for my taste - I would have wanted stronger coffee (less cream) flavor, but it was still quite satisfying.  This lower Greenville location is well situated between eateries and bars so I could imagine the lines could ebb and flow quite a bit depending on foot traffic."
710,10/17/2014,Rick B.,dallas-2,4,"Need a snack grab a pop! Lower Greenville is a cool little strip of about 3 blocks of restaurants. Made me think of all the cool swanky spots on 1st / 2nd ave / Belltown area in Seattle. Well, kinda. Everyone keeps raving about these pops so....I parked my car and hopped on in to Steel City Pops.Venue.Small. Unassuming. Efficient. The pops are individually wrapped and placed inside a garden variety dipping case. Instead the cases are square white food safe buckets of pops. Ok, that merchandising is terrible, but also, some charm. I am on the fence on that one. Next step is to stare at the board of flavors. There are abut 20.  Order your pop. Pay the three bucks. Then get the hell out.I ordered two. Don't you dare judge me. I will hit the gym today nice and hard to make up for my huge slippage yesterday. (guilty face)Butter Pecan.Good flavor, a bit icy.* No chunks of pecan. Boo!  I ate the whole thing.Mocha.Light on the chocolate and the coffee flavor, a bit icy. I ate the whole thing. *By icy, I mean a very cold mouth feel that takes over the flavor and freezes your pallet to the point where all you tastes is sweet and cold and little of the flavor. Technically, it has to do with the freezing method and the size and amount of ice crystals. I will shut the heck up on that... :) I had a bottle of water with me so the icy thing was not an issue. Bite of pop, drink of water, repeat!  No problemoBoth the Mocha and the Butter Pecan were from the creamy section. Summary.Cool location. Hipsterish employees. Good pops. Spot to chill outside and eat your pop! I would go there again. They are only $3 bucks. The girl sitting next to me was super cute. I think that made my pop taste better. Is that possible?4 Stars for sure! Yea, I was nit picking about the icy thing but those pops are good. $3 bucks for a few min of frozen happiness is well worth it.  Check em out!"
711,8/15/2014,Teresa V.,dallas-2,5,"I was always a fan of waffle coned ice creams over popsicles but this place definitely makes a good comeback for posicles my friends. Had a try of their coffee, and strawberry cream popsicles off their creamy menu and a try at their peach flavor off the fruity menu. First off, I'm a true sucker for anything coffee related so I immediately went after the coffee and man! it was on point! exactly the way I would imagine a good cup of ice coffee on a stick! Had a taste of my cousin's order of the strawberry cream popsicle and it was the perfect blend of rich creaminess and refreshness; also had a go at my sister's order of their peach fruity popsicle and it was very refreshing! Great place to grab a small, light dessert after dinner with some friends! The overall environment was clean, service was friendly, you can certainly count on me coming back for another round. Though, I can't quite imagine how the experience will be walking out eating these popsicles, especially the creamy ones, in the hot Texas summer heat. As for pricing...hey, if you're willing to buy from the ice cream truck then you'll definitely get more of your money's worth here. Sure you can probably get cheaper at the super market somewhere down the street but for the overall experience, it's definitely more worth it for you to come here with your buds if you're in the area."

Updated review",Lilian N.,dallas-2,5,"2nd time I've been to this location and I don't want to rant, but I will. Great pops BUT the workers during this shift looked like they disliked their job. If you're going to have a stank face, don't even say Hi, or make eye contact while you're working than I suggest get a different job where you don't have to deal with people. You're the face that represents a business - be appreciative and show that you like your job, at least. Goodness. I understand that it gets hot and it stays super busy, but you knew what you were getting yourself into when you applied for a job. Fake it till you make it, booboo."
713,10/4/2014,Jim S.,dallas-2,5,"Loved the Popsicle here. I would say Steel City is doing what froyo did to the mass population a few years back. Really cute date place~There is parking pretty close by, and it's nice to a bunch of nice bars/restaurants. Awesome for post dinner dessert. Place is pretty small but that is of no significance. Outdoor seating is the place to be! Going in, you can select from a wide range of popsicles. I tried the mocha, which was great, but my friends who had Bacon (??) and strawberry both really liked it! I would say the popsicles are not super sweet, but sweet enough to be a good dessert. Plus they are only 3 bucks a pop (all pun intended).Only downside is that their flavors rotate, so I couldn't try out some of their more ""famous flavors', namely avocado. :( FOR NEXT TIME!"
714,1/9/2015,Kim D.,dallas-2,3,"It's located on Greenville Ave right across from Trader Joe's and some trendy eats in Dallas. They were pretty good, but 12 bucks for 3 is pretty pricey. I ordered a chocolate dipped vanilla bean cream popsicle and two friends ordered buttermilk, and banana; both dipped in chocolate. The dipping chocolate had a weird coconut aftertaste to it that was not okay. I get it, they were  being healthy and organic using coconut oil, but...just ew. I'd like to try some of the other flavors though, maybe when the weather warms up. Just avoid the chocolate."
715,7/22/2014,Angel P.,dallas-2,4,"Finally got to try this place and luckily there wasn't really a line! I was really looking forward to trying Blueberry Basil but it wasn't available on the day I came so I ended up with Strawberry Cream. My only disappointment was that I didn't try more flavors! AHH it was soooo good! It was really thick and creamy, not like the cheap popsicle you get at the grocery store that melts super fast. This had actual strawberries grinded up into a rich creamy flavor. It was almost like eating a milkshake on a stick, delicious. The price is a bit high for popsicles but really.. its not your average popsicle and with how many licks it takes to get to the stick, your $3 is well worth it. I shall be back!!"
716,7/25/2014,Jason S.,dallas-2,4,"Popsicles(Or for you non US peeps: freeze pop (Ireland), ice lolly (United Kingdom and Ireland), ice block, icy pole (parts of Australia and New Zealand), chihiro (Cayman Islands) [Source: Wikipedia])For those unfamiliar with the food item, there are 3 important things to know about 'em:-They are cold-They are convenient to carry & to consume-They (usually) contain sugarBut really, they aren't that complex or noteworthy. Sweet, lickable frozen things on a stick.I would not recommend this as a 'destination' spot.However, their low temperature and convenience make them ideal desserts for the wonderful Texas Summer.  Combined with their high quality and good variety of changing & unique flavors make 'Steel City Pops' a great stop if you happen to be in the area.__________________________Conclusion:I will likely stop by whenever I am in the area to chill with their wonderful flavors whenever I am nearby, but it is not something I will drive a distance for.(Translation: I liked it, but all the fantastic reviews set my expectations too high.  They are still just popsicles and expectations need to be kept under control)"
717,7/13/2014,Grace S.,dallas-2,4,"Whoever thought to open this place is a genius. Long hot summers, a busy pedestrian-friendly area, and low overhead. How can a business go wrong? The line at Steel City Pops is often out the door, with the line moving at a moderate pace. Although the entire transaction consists of the counter person pulling a popsicle out of the freezer and cutting open the plastic, the process seems to be slowed down by those who can't decide which flavor they want. Speaking of flavors, they've got many. From icy fruity flavors to creamy flavors. Some include unconventional ingredients like chili or avocado. And all of the flavors I've tried so far have tasted delicious and wholesome.One downside: they sometimes run out of flavors. So make sure to have a good backup flavor while waiting in line. They ran out of coconut on my last visit and it completely ruined my night. ;)"
718,8/11/2014,Annie N.,dallas-2,5,"On a hot summer day I prefer a popsicle over ice cream. I find that ice cream melts too fast, gets too sticky, and is less satisfying than a refreshing, ice cold popsicle. I've always wondered why there are so many ice cream shops and no popsicle shops besides your old-school ice cream trucks that are simply overpriced.Therefore, I was super happy to try Steel City Pops - it's cheap & delicious. The flavors are unique and you can tell that they use fresh ingredients. They have two categories (fruity & creamy) with rotating flavors.Here's a list of flavors I've nibbled on, tried and devoured - 'MUST GET' FLAVORS: 1. blood orange - a hybrid between orange & grapefruit. Delicious and refreshing. 2. coffee - ahhh you can smell the coffee the instant you slip the popsicle out of the bag. 3. Mango - this tastes like a real mango on a stick. Fresh, fruity, and true to its mango flavor. 4. Pumpkin - Tastes like a pumpkin - rich in the pumpkin flavor and delicious!5. Passion Fruit - Best part? They use real passion fruit. 6. Orange Mint Green Tea - Very mild in flavor, but refreshing.NOT MY FAVES, BUT WORTH-A-TRY FLAVORS:1. pineapple jalapeno -  tasted like pineapples dipped in chili salt (you'll understand what I mean if you're viet!). It's one of those flavors that's good at first lick then gets cloying by the 5th one. 2. Bacon & Bourbon - You can definitely taste the bourbon, and I'm not the biggest fan of whiskey. However, there are bacon chunks at the bottom, which complemented the bourbon flavor well. MEH:1. Coconut - if you're a fan of coconut flavored things then you'll like this flavor. However, I'm not so I found this flavor to be too ""coconut-y"" and creamy.2. Any of the cookie pops - The cookie pops sound like a good idea, but the texture makes it annoying to eat. Since the cookie (or brownie) is frozen, it breaks into tiny pieces that remind me of coffee grind."
719,7/5/2014,Myia B.,dallas-2,4,The quick version: that Buttermilk popsicle was the best I've ever had.Long version: The cooler bag of 4 popsicles cost $10.82.  The cooler bag will keep your popsicles frozen for about 40 minutes.  They have creamy and fruity popsicles.  The menu isn't extensive but it is unique and I think the average person will find something that they like.  The store front is small...there are only a few seats inside...there are a few more just outside the front door.  Quick service...you should be in and out within a couple of minutes.  The storefront sign is low key - look for Trader Joe's...SCP is across the street.  Tee shirts average $15.Buttermilk: 5 starsVanilla Bean: 4.5 starsHibiscus: didn't get to taste it :(Blueberry Basil: 2 stars (wasn't my thing...basil got caught in my invisalign hooks too so be careful eating this one if you don't have floss & a toothbrush handy)I shall return.
720,7/31/2014,Sandra P.,dallas-2,5,"I absolutely love this place! Not necessarily all of the flavors, but I have a couple favorites! They use all natural or certified organic ingredients and natural cane sugar, and they never use preservatives or artificial flavors.You can get a 4 pack of pops for $10 that comes in a bag with an ice pack. Actually, we didn't get an ice pack one of the two times we ordered this way, so not sure what's typical. Coffee- my favorite! Fine ground coffee sits at the top of the Popsicle, equivalent to the chocolate at the bottom of a drumstick. Wish they coated the entire perimeter of the Popsicle with this ground coffee. Not sure why Popsicle is autocorrected to a capital P, but I like it. Strawberry cream- my other favorite. It's exactly what you'd expect it to taste like. Perfection.Sweet tea- straight up frozen sweet tea in Popsicle form. Can't go wrong with sweet tea popsicles on a hot summer day.Peanut butter- anticipated it to be too PB-y, but the flavor was surprisingly well balanced! I only had a bite so I'm not sure if I would've been able to finish an entire Popsicle of PB goodness. Definitely coming back for more!"
721,10/3/2014,Andrew C.,dallas-2,5,"Holy smoley. If you love iced sweetness in your mouth, this is the place to go.Unique flavors accompanied by a super friendly staff. Only downside, however, is the price tag. At $3 a pop (pun intended), you'd expect a rather large popsicle. Either way, this is the good stuff.Tried out the Sweet tea, strawberry, watermelon, and mango pops. This place can do no wrong it appears. They were all very flavorful and full of goodness. Definitely worth a stop!"
722,8/11/2014,Taylor C.,dallas-2,5,"My dad and I stopped by for some Popsicles after dinner and these were a treat indeed. We both opted for fruity popsicles as opposed to the creamy; I got peach and he got blood-orange. The consistency of the popsicle is hard to explain but it's not like a grocery store popsicle. They were delicious and refreshing, especially in this Texas heat. The girl who rang us up even opened them for us to save us the trouble. The actual store is a bit small, but once we ordered we left and sat outside, and although it was 95 degrees outside, sitting under the shade wasn't too bad at all. Overall, these popsicles exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend!!"
723,7/30/2015,Jina C.,dallas-2,5,"Can I just say... I LOVE Steel City Pops! It is one of my most favorite places to go for dessert. It is located on Lower Greenville, where parking can be a nightmare, but I still go because they are that good! The place itself is small with limited seating, so most people just get their popsicles and leave or sit on the wooden benches outside. The line can be out the door during peak hours, but it goes by fast. I have tried almost all of their flavors, both fruity and cream... and all of them have been nothing but amazing! They have such unique flavor combinations and they use fresh ingredients like real fruit juice. They even have cookie pops now, where there is a cookie inside the popsicle. Genius! My all-time favorite flavors though, would have to be Blood Orange, Coffee, and Strawberry Cream."
724,7/22/2016,Emily P.,dallas-2,5,"Best popsicle ever!!!! Love that place, coconut is my favorite, also cherry sour cream is good, peach cream is good, vanilla is good...."
725,6/28/2016,Dizzy D.,dallas-2,4,"Wide variety of flavors. I had the passion fruit. On a hot Dallas day, this is a sure way to beat the heat. You really can't go wrong here. Will definitely be back."
726,11/4/2015,Anthony C.,dallas-2,5,"dig the concept of capitalizing on popsicles, coffee flavor was excellent. will be coming back to try more flavors. luckily there was NO line when I showed up.can I buy these online and have them shipped to my house????"
727,4/5/2016,Tracy L.,dallas-2,4,"OMG...just go get a Vanilla Chocolate Chip popsicle! It's soo yummilicious!! I love how there's real fruits in the fruity popsicles, too. I will say that after eating 2/3 of it really fast, I did get a brain freeze and sugar comatose. It's still soo good, though!"
728,9/21/2015,Andy P.,dallas-2,3,I love watching how busy this place gets during the summer. Lines out the door and people willing to spend $3 for a single popsicle. Made props to the owners. Some of the flavors are plain. I think the fruity ones aren't much better than your grocery store variety but the creamy or cookie pops are pretty awesome. Back to the line - they're pretty quick and offer good packaging if you need to take some home or deliver to someone you like enough to spend $3 for a popsicle.
729,7/4/2014,Jennifer J.,dallas-2,5,"Steel City Pops is the tops! The whole idea is brilliant - unique and traditional popsicles, nothing more, nothing less. And a very affordable price. We had the cherry sour cream (delicious), vanilla (delicious), caramel (delicious), and strawberry balsamic (delicious). Did I mention everything was delicious???The gals working the counter were very friendly and took the time to explain all of the flavors. They have a policy where if you don't like your first choice, they will replace it for free, so go ahead and be adventurous. An added benefit was that I didn't feel overly full or guilty when I was done. They also have a loyalty program if you're in to that."
730,7/8/2016,emily c.,dallas-2,5,One of the must stops here in Dallas. Best Popsicle that I ever had. I had the coffee my so had the root beer and my husband had mango and they were all awesome. My son couldn't resist and asked for a 2nd pop and the strawberry one was awesome too.
731,6/28/2015,Abbey B.,dallas-2,5,"This place is amazing!Little known fact: If you do NOT like your popsicle, they will replace it, FREE of charge!!That should have you try them alone!Favorite flavors: Strawberry lemonade, Coconut, Watermelon, Blood Orange, Coffee, and any Cookie Pop!Also, they're punch cards are great! I have yet to have a poor experience and I come at least once a week for the past couple months.  The young staff is incredibly helpful and friendly, quick, and will always replace a pop if I don't like it. The best neighborhood spot on a hot summer night!"
732,6/14/2015,Giselle B.,dallas-2,5,"Five stars x2! If there were 10 stars I would give it to this place, just SO good best pops ever. We had a Lime Pop that was so refreshing and flavorful... and OMG the coconut Pop by far my favorite, so creamy, with real coconut which gives it an amazing texture and the coconut flavor! coming from a tropical island I can tell you this is the real stuff. So delighted with the service and the store."
733,7/30/2014,Alex Q.,dallas-2,4,"I love cold treats in all forms: ice cream, gelato, froyo, popsicles etc so I agreed to try out this place with a friend. It's a tiny little place almost directly in front of Trader Joe's. I got the avocado which is under their creamy category. I know avocado is a hard flavor to capture but I wasn't too impressed by their take on it. There were other flavors that overpowered any hint of the avocado so that after two bites I was convinced I was eating some kind of lime (and maybe ginger) popsicle. It wasn't the worst though so I'd probably go back to try out their other flavors."
734,7/29/2014,Stacy Y.,dallas-2,5,"So much sweet, rich, fruity flavor in a small package! This place seems to always have a line outside (especially since it's summer), but the line moves really quickly. They have a bunch of flavors classified into either fruity or creamy. I ordered the peach and tried the watermelon. The peach was very refreshing and sweet, while the watermelon definitely had a touch of lemon juice to give it a tart kick. They also provide these really cool insulating bags that prevent the popsicles from melting if you want to-go. I will definitely be back and want to try some of the creamy flavors next time!"
735,7/2/2016,Jenn T.,dallas-2,5,"A sweet cool treat in the summer heat! They offer a great assortment of flavors it's hard to pick just one! For my first pop I picked the piña colada flavor. I was worried that piña colada was a bad choice considering how many other exciting flavors there were to choose from, but boy was I wrong. From the first bite not only was it delicious but I could tell that the pop was made with quality ingredients. It was also fun to sit at the stools inside the store and watch the pop employees make and package the pops. I'll definitely be back to try other flavors. (:"
736,3/24/2015,Kennedy V.,dallas-2,5,"Love this place! It is great for a sunny day and great weather. The fruit pops (raspberry lemon) are definitely my favorite. The cream ones are okay, but I always wish I ended up picking a fruit. Had/have chocolate dipping to add to your pop, but I would not suggest buttermilk with it. Many people say it's their favorite and it taste like cheesecake. It does not!"
737,7/27/2014,Julie L.,dallas-2,4,"They had 2 types: fruity and creamy. We tried creamy vanilla bean and fruity blood orange. Vanilla bean is definitely a favorite. They were out of the popular flavors like hibiscus and watermelon at the time, but will definitely be back to try the rest! Buy a 4 pack, it equals to $2.50 instead of $3 a pop! And they come in an insulated pouch."
738,6/2/2014,Cristina O.,dallas-2,5,"I mean, what could possibly cause less than 5 stars?! You've got one product and you do it well. The pops are so delicious! The lemonade is my favorite and perfect for a hot summer day. What a great concept! Get in, get a Popsicle and get out. Total is $3 a pop, but they honestly are huge I almost couldn't finish mine. I can't wait to go back!   ** I will say the girl working the fruit side this day was not very pleasant but whatever 8 don't need small talk just a pop so not lien I have to hang around."
739,9/3/2015,Jennifer W.,dallas-2,4,"I've bought a few 12-packs over throughout the year so I think it's fair to say I've tried quite a few flavors and I like them enough to keep going back. A few standouts are:The bad: avocado (tasted limey/sour.. Asian avocado ice cream is much tastier), watermelon (tasted like they used an overripe watermelon and too much sugar for my batch). The best: strawberry shortcake, buttermilk, and sweet tea."
740,6/3/2015,Jenny B.,dallas-2,4,"I LOVE STEEL CITY POPS!You absolutely have to try the cookie pops!! Their pops are so creamy! It doesn't have an icy texture to it, like the popsicles you buy from the grocery store. The workers are so nice. My friend got the avocado flavor (which we were  both very excited because we love avocado), but it had a lime flavor to it. You couldn't really taste the avocado. We thought the worker gave us the wrong flavor, but that's just how the avocado flavor is. We were pretty disappointed about that, but we were given a new flavor for FREE! My friend switched it out for coconut, which was very yummy!I would definitely come back a thousand times more!"
741,6/24/2014,Amee M.,dallas-2,5,"A gourmet popsicle shop.  This place is pretty simple and straightforward.  Don't be discouraged by a long line - it moves quickly.  The real nuisance is parking anywhere in that area.They've categorized their menu into two groups:  Creamy & FruityThe great thing is that they have a good mix of traditional or unique flavors but also some flavors that just tiptoe outside of traditional, such as Blueberry Basil.  We tried more of the unique/signature flavors such as Jalapeno Pineapple, Chili Chocolate, and Avocado.  We also ordered Blueberry Basil.It's tempting to go for something different, but I encourage you to get what you're really in the mood for.  I got the Pineapple Jalapeno, but I really just wanted something simple like Watermelon.  Only choose something different if that's what you really want, but either way, you won't be disappointed.  :)All of the inventory is right up front.  Pay cash for a quick visit.  4 pops for $10 is a reasonable deal.Order, pay, grab the popsicles and head back out the door to the semi-covered wooden benches that line the perimeter of their ""porch"".  Most people will be taking about 10 mins and then move on.  As the summer gets hotter, I think that number will get even smaller.  Crowds are pleasantly varied from new parents, to empty nesters, to families, to hipsters, to vacationers, to the usual Uptown/Greenville 20-somethings and 30-somethings.Even in moderate heat, the popsicles do get ""drippy"" (as expected) so you might want to watch out for that on the benches unless you want Blueberry Basil pants.It's a great stop for a quick summertime treat and it has a seemingly quick revolving door to make it painless."
742,11/6/2015,Jeanne C.,dallas-2,5,"Steel City Pops is THE best! I've never had such fortune as to actually try one yet, but it came highly recommended from co-workers to send as a gift to one of our customers in the Dallas area. I am writing this from Northern California, people, where we don't have the honor of having a store here yet of these wonderous cold treats. But I digress. At the request of my boss and her team, I coordinated with the Dallas Steel City Pops mgr to get a fairly large order over to our customer to thank them (for so many things!) and boy was it well received.What started as a phone call and email exchange with the Irving store, turned into full fledge support and follow up (order, transaction, delivery) from the Dallas store since they were closer to our customer. So helpful over the phone and such care given to the order and process. They packed it all up in dry ice; made it to our customer on time and in their actual hands pretty quick thereafter."
743,8/24/2014,Siobhan F.,dallas-2,5,Great popsicles! Blood Orange and Hibiscus are my favorites as of my after two visits.
744,5/30/2016,Laura B.,dallas-2,4,Best Popsicle around so far! Customer service not always the best but they are human! They are always very busy! Be ready to stand in line. The pops are worth it. My favorite is the Blood Orange!!
745,8/6/2014,Catherine L.,dallas-2,4,This place is genius. So simple but yet so genius that I want to give it less stars to make myself feel better for not thinking of this first. They have a huge variety of Popsicles I believe they make in house. These include fruity and creamy Popsicles. I decided I wanted to be adventurous so I went with pineapple and jalapeño. It was quite interesting-kind of tasted like it should be some sort of salsa- I liked it but part of me also kind of wished I went with another flavor. The jalapeno was a little spicy for me. I noticed while I was there at around 2:30 pm they do run out of their popular flavors so you may want to get there earlier than later. I really can't wait to go back and try another flavor!
746,10/27/2014,Krystal T.,dallas-2,5,"The creamy pops... All I can say is WoW. My friend bought the coffee pop and it taste like robust iced coffee. I bought the sweet potato pecan, also delish!  They have a lot of flavors and you can request a flavor you like too! I would like to request Strawberry, Cheesecake, Lemon Pie, Key Lime Pie, and Mango-Lime"
747,10/25/2014,Mike L.,dallas-2,4,"Steel City Pops is a cool place to get a different kind of dessert than normal. Their pops come in a bunch of different flavors from chocolate to pumpkin pie to strawberry. With tax, the popsicles come out to be exactly $3.I got the strawberry one and you can really taste the fruit and that they used actual ingredients for flavoring. The chocolate and coffee ones taste more like ice cream while the fruity ones are more classic popsicle tasting4/5 for tasting good, even though they're kinda expensive. While not blow your mind good, they are worth trying."
748,6/9/2015,Rae I.,dallas-2,5,"Who doesn't love a Popsicle?Everyone does and that is why when you're in the vicinity of this shop, you will see these Popsicles ALL OVER the place, bobbing up and down the street. First time in, will be back. Love the concept!!!I had the blood orange, my friend had the guava. We both loved ours. I would describe the blood orange as well balanced, not too sweet. Good flavor!! I am not crazy about orange juice and the like but I loved this!!! Some popsicles just taste like frozen water, like the flavor just settled in the bottom or something. These are nicely flavored, evenly, throughout the whole popsicle. Very enjoyable. It's a quick in and out stop, you pick your Popsicle from the reach in counter freezers and they open it, hand it to you protected by the wrapper and you grab it by the stick. You're ready to go! A really refreshing treat on a hot day and the price is just right that you aren't breaking the bank."
749,8/10/2014,Stefanie L.,dallas-2,4,"Really tiny! I had the buttermilk Popsicle and it was suuuuper sweet. I don't know if I would I would go out of my way I get a Popsicle here, but it wasn't bad. The boyfriend got a peanut butter Popsicle and even for a hardcore peanut butter fanatic it was too much. Okay place, I don't know if it's worth the hype."
750,10/20/2014,Margaret B.,dallas-2,5,"Dat pineapple jalapeno tho.....Delicious, dense and creamy popsicles in exotic flavors. If you get lucky with parking or live close by, this place is a great destination.I wanna go back to try their fall flavors.  Seems appropriate in a place that sees 80 degree weather in October.  Try as I might to enjoy a Pumpkin Spice Latte, I'm usually forming a sweat-stache (sweat mustache? anybody?) 1/3rd into my cup."
751,7/13/2014,Aaron L.,dallas-2,5,"Their exotic and alluring favors definitely make it worthwhile! I'm a huge fan of ice cream and yogurt, but how could we forget those flavored sticks of ice that we all used to make ourselves using ice trays and toothpicks! At $3 a pop conveniently placed on a busy, high cultured area, it's no wonder the craze for flavored blocks of ice is the word on the street, so park for free off Prospect Avenue and come grab a pop or two.After a couple satisfying visits with some pop-hungry peers, I've learned to buy a bag (4 pops for $10) as a simple way to save a couple bucks while still enjoying various flavors with friends! Or if your appetite is greater than your brain freeze, a box (12 pops for $30) would be a fun party favor (if it doesn't melt by then -they give bags with ice, but it's all a matter of time).This place is clean (besides your Popsicle dripping on the floor at times), simple, and cool. The line may seem long, but just like your pop, it'll pass quick, so add this to your to-do list if you're ever by Greenville! Cool place to chill! :)"
752,7/31/2015,Roderick J.,dallas-2,4,"Yummy Yummy Yummy this place is busy but it's worth it for a hot summer day.  Only one star missing for NOT having a sugar free line for those in need of that.  But flavors off the chart all we tried EXCELLENT.  Hint, if you have four in your party, get the BAG for four, it saves you a quarter per POP, and you get a cool stay cold bag."
753,2/13/2016,Wing S.,dallas-2,5,"The only other popsicle place I know is back home in Hawaii, so this place was one seriously welcome find. Bonus points for being reasonably priced!! Got the Satsuma Cream, which is like a well-mixed dreamsicle with bits of orange peel settled at the top. I was happy to find that it wasnt overly sweet like so many other popsicles and the flavors weren't artificial tasting at all. I do wish they had some more adventurous flavor combinations though. Regardless, id love to come back again."
754,7/27/2015,Johnson L.,dallas-2,4,"This place have really cool and awesome popsicles, they have all different flavor like jalapeno pineapple, strawberry short cake, Fudge etc. I had the jalapeno pineapple this time. It sounds weird, but it turn out awesome, that jalapeno spice give the popsicles a twist. I would swing by some time to get Popsicle when I am in that area definitely."
755,8/7/2015,Amanda R.,dallas-2,5,"Very delicious!I'd never heard of this place before a friend suggested it, but apparently it's a pretty popular place. The employees said that sometimes the line will go out the door...which I find pretty impressive for a Popsicle shop. I tried the Passion Fruit flavor and it was so refreshing!! My friend had the Chocolate Brownie one and said it was amazing. It was chocolate ice cream with a brownie in the middle!They have the calorie count next to each flavor so for anyone who keeps track of their calories, don't worry it's on the board."
756,7/11/2014,Angel N.,dallas-2,4,"Awesome fruit flavors or creamy flavors!  They have pop packs they are sold for a small bulk discount and packed with a ice pack too!  If you buy one pop, it costs $3 each and is totally worth it!  The perfectly rectangle pop is bursting with a freshness and flavor!  The workers are nice friendly and know their products well!  I like how they will open your pop for you as well.  I tried the Banana cream pop that had a hint of cinnamon/ spice which I wasn't expecting.  It was decadent and creamy but not super banana flavor as I would want. Now as for the cucumber lime... That was mind blowing.  It was clean, fresh, a hint of tart and sweet.  I love it!  I also tried part of my husbands blood orange and was very pleased with this flavor as well. It was a tad sweeter than I thought it would be, but still awesome!  Can't wait to try the rest of the flavors! I mean who can resist a pop made with fresh ingredients and cane syrup?"
757,11/27/2015,Kiefer S.,dallas-2,5,"I don't usually like popsicles but Steel City slays me every time. They always have a few normal flavors (lemonade, strawberry, etc) but the unique ones draw my eye. I've seen things like maple bacon bourbon, fig and cheese, and tomatillo on the menu. The cookie pops (cookie dough with a creamy popsicle frozen around it) are exactly as good as they sound.Pro-tip: get certain flavors (coffee, coconut, etc) dipped in chocolate for an addition $1. They dip it right in front of you and the chocolate freezes around the popsicle."
758,10/4/2014,Rachel N.,dallas-2,4,"If I had written a review for my first visit, it would have been 2-3 stars.GET THE MAJARETE. Perfection, I want more but sadly will never know when I'll be able to have it again since they switch out flavors a lot.Majarete - We had to google what this flavor was while in line. Dominican Corn Pudding. Three of us decided to give it a shot. It sort of tasted like Vietnamese Che Bap, with TONS of corn pieces in the ice cream. Sweet corn flavor with cinnamon, never knew this combo would work. I can't rave enough!!My first pop was jalapeño pineapple - interesting but not my style. I couldn't even get through half of the pop. I've also tried the peach pop which was really good! The coffee one wasn't strong enough for me coffee wise. It was also too sweet and left a nasty cream film in my mouth. Next time I go, and I see majarete on the board, I'm going to take home a bag for myself!"
759,8/8/2015,Nutmeg Y.,dallas-2,3,"A pop is a pop is a pop.  Take this review with a grain of salt.  I am a non-pop lover, but was hoping to be converted to one by the supposed best pop store out there.  I had the Cantaloupe but was not wowed.  Tasted like fresh fruit purée frozen into a pop shape.  I guess that's what a pop is.  Still not impressed - I can do that myself?  It had a bit of it bitterness to it as well.  Sorry this gal did not get converted.  I'll stick with ice-cream.  Others love this place.  I just don't like pops."
760,7/20/2015,Rose I.,dallas-2,4,"Very long line out the door on a Sunday night. It moved relatively quick though so not a big deal. They were out of Watermelon so I tried Strawberry. Very good and tasted like real fruit, just a little too sweet for my taste. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because after walking out and along Greenville, the pop started to melt within about 5-7 minutes and started going all over my fingers even after i used a napkin to catch the runoff under the pop. I was thinking that they could invest in some pop covers that will catch all the melted excess so you don't get sticky fingers. That was the main issue I had with them. Otherwise flavor and concept is great! I will be back to check out other flavors."
761,6/5/2016,Shauna L.,dallas-2,5,I got peach. Husband got caramel. Yum. Plus they have a 4 pack in a special sack to keep your pops to go frozen for 30 minutes.
762,9/17/2014,James P.,dallas-2,5,"I kept seeing pictures of my friends on Facebook eating popsicles from this place called Steel City Pops so curiosity got me and I had to check out. Best popsicles of my life. Then again, these are the only popsicles I ever had that did not come from an ice cream truck or the freezer at Walmart, so there's that. Every flavor (except buttermilk) is good so just pick something and go with it. No favorites so far."
763,7/30/2015,Mili K.,dallas-2,5,"Frozen pops on a hot summer day-what's not to love?!?!  Even better all the calories are posted, so you can decide what's the best option for you!  Must check it out now!"
764,8/5/2014,Mitchy M.,dallas-2,4,"Well there's not much for me to say about this spot.  It's close to several places that I frequent.  It's a good place to people watch and the pops are tasty.  I'm still shocked that I'm paying $3 for ONE popsicle!  Is it worth it?  Well let's just say I'm a regular at this little popsicle joint!  There are a variety of flavors.  There's always a crowd, but the line moves fast."
765,9/3/2015,Jane K.,dallas-2,4,"If you're ever in lower Greenville, you should try this place out! It's a good little dessert after eating around the area. Just as a forewarning, the place is pretty small and the lines are usually long, which means that the line tends to go out the door. On hot summer days, this is the worst... although the line does tend to go by pretty fast.The staff is always friendly and I like how they open the wrapper of the popsicle for you. You can choose between categories of milky/creamy ice cream or the fruity ones or the ones with brownie (or was it cookies?) inside. My popsicle of choice would have to be the coffee. If I'm feeling fat, I like the coffee brownie one! They're both delicious and the reason why I keep returning, even though I live so far away.... I've dared to venture out and try the avocado one... but it wasn't as great.. Actually, I didn't like it at all. Although this place has some great popsicles, I think the hype that was put on it was a little too much. It's always a hit or miss with some of these flavors."
766,6/8/2015,Robyn S.,dallas-2,5,"Bless you, Steel City, for making your way into my town and my neighborhood. I didn't even know I liked popsicles until I stumbled in here with my kids after an evening at the Truck Yard. I figured ""what the hell"" and ordered the pineapple-jalapeno popsicle. OMG. It's like you figured out a way to put all of my fruit and vegetable servings into one. perfect. pop. Extraordinary.My kids go for the simple stuff. Strawberry. Lemon. And they like it. But it's me -- the ""i don't even like popsicles"" person -- that suggests a trip to Steel City every time we're remotely in the vicinity of your store. Nicely played."
767,4/19/2016,Ellen M.,dallas-2,5,"Wow who would have thought? So simple but so delicious! We had chocolate, peanut butter, and coconut. Coconut has to be my favorite. Then hubs decided to try one more so we got toasted marshmallow. Insane that it tasted like you just roasted a marshmallow over s bonfire! It's crazy"
768,4/8/2015,Kathy D.,dallas-2,5,"I always attempt to ""try something new"" and end up trying to switch with my fiancé who always gets the same thing. Hands down, the vanilla bean always takes the win."
769,8/21/2015,Kyle H.,dallas-2,4,Look they are the best Popsicles you will likely ever have. However prices are steep. Points back on the awesome customer service.
770,5/28/2016,Cayley O.,dallas-2,5,Came here based on reviews and it totally lived up! So many fun flavors to choose from I will definitely be back to try them all! I had the passion fruit and my sister had the honeydew- both delicious!
771,4/1/2016,Megan A.,dallas-2,5,"AMAZING Popsicles--so delicious that I still enjoyed eating them in the colder weather while walking outside. I had the coffee Popsicle (which is basically like ice cream in Popsicle form) and my cousin had the raspberry-lemon fruit based Popsicle. The coffee flavor was not too overwhelming but enough that you get the coffee fix. My cousin said the raspberry-lemon was good and you could tell the fruit they made the Popsicle with was fresh. All of their Popsicles are homemade and it's the best Popsicle you could possibly get out there. The Popsicles run for $3 and if you don't like the flavor you picked, you can exchange it, free of charge!"
772,8/30/2015,Larryn A.,dallas-2,4,"This place makes you remember all those times you chased the ice cream truck for a ice cream pop, or all the family summer bbqs when you got your favorite popsicle. I truly love this little place. The line can get long, but it does move fast. The pops I have tried so far we're damn good except for the avocado lime...just...no. Unless you like oddly tart flavors then maybe pass on that one lol. If you're lucky enough to grab a strawberry cream when they have it, please get it! The best! Service here is great also and plenty of places to sit around outside."
773,6/6/2014,Rachel F.,dallas-2,5,I just had the avocado pop and it was AMAZING! I love anything avocado and this didn't disappoint. It was creamy and tasted similar to key lime pie (which is also one of my favorites!) It was the perfect afternoon treat in the hot heat of summer. Definitely will be going back!
774,2/25/2015,Naser A.,dallas-2,5,"What have I been missing my entire life!!!!' I am so glad we stopped here after dinner for dessert cause to be honest with you, it's the best I've ever had vanilla cookie pops was to die for it was recommended by the manager on duty. He was so nice and friendly talked with home for the entire visit. Will definitely go back soon"
775,7/25/2014,Janice C.,dallas-2,3,"Although it was good, I didnt feel that it was anything special... I got the blackberry and it tasted like sweetened blackberries... For $3 a popsicle I expect to be wowed but I was like meh.... its good but its not great. I ll prob go back and try another flavor but for all the hype, I was disappointed."
776,11/13/2016,Janie H.,dallas-2,1,This business runs on over charging your order. We walked away after receiving our order and were falsely charged for additional items we didn't order. When we returned he immediately knew why we were there. This man is a con artist! Look at your charges before you leave.
777,5/3/2016,Eileen N.,dallas-2,4,Love the neighborhood.. The retro vibes.. Good service.. Good after having some food in the near by restaurants.. I had the creamy coffee pop.
778,11/22/2015,Hailey B.,dallas-2,3,"I've been here multiple times with family, friends, and the kids I nanny. Each time I have gotten something different to branch out and try new things. At first, I really gave into the hype because the summer flavors were AMAZING! The avocado has been my favorite! Strawberry lemonade was to die for. But as they received their fall flavors, I haven't been that big of a fan. Rhubarb was a hard flavor to like for me, I really wanted to like it. The pumpkin flavored pop was really heavy for me and I couldn't finish it because it's pretty thick. Maybe that's just me. But during the fall, I can't justify spending anywhere from 3-6 dollars on a popsicle. I'll be back though, once spring/summer rolls around! I do have to say, the staff here handle their rushes quite well and with such grace!"
779,3/23/2016,Pearl I.,dallas-2,5,Very fun place to take your kids during the summer. They have glass walls where they make their Popsicles so your kids can watch while they eat their Popsicles how their dessert is made! They also have a card you could get stamps every time you go there to earn yourself a free popsicle! The place is packed but the wait is worth it! They have various flavors from fruits to chocolate or even unique ones like avocado. There are also several nice restaurants you could go to first then pop in to this place after! Trader Joe's is across the street so we usually go grocery shopping then come by before we go home.
780,9/26/2015,Sivilay H.,dallas-2,5,"At first I wasn't sure if I would want ""just"" a Popsicle for dessert so we walked Greenville Avenue to see if there were other alternatives.  (Plus there was a long line at Steel City Pops.) As it turns out, there really aren't other options for dessert since the ice cream place by Truck Yard wasn't open.So, we went back to Steel City Pops, which fortunately for us had a shorter line by now, and I'm glad we did so.  I ordered the Chocolate Brownie cookie pop which was excellent!  Popsicle licking good."
781,3/31/2016,Katie R.,dallas-2,5,"I don't understand how popsicles can be so good. The Avocado is my favorite! It's massive and creamy, and only 150 calories. Love coming here after dinner!"
782,"3/5/2016
            





Updated review",Victoria P.,dallas-2,5,Just tried their mango and strawberry lemonade flavors. So freaking refreshing! I wish I had bought some to take home!!! Must make another trip there ASAP since the weather is getting warmer.
783,3/30/2015,Annie L.,dallas-2,5,"I've always heard about this place and thought that it was going to be overhyped (like, how good can a Popsicle get?). But when coming here this place was great! We got the 4 pops for $11 (blackberry, coffee, blueberry cream, and sweet tea. Coffee was my FAVORITE. Absolutely delicious and there were coffee grounds mixed into the Popsicle. If you're doubting this place because it's been hyped up, come anyways! I think it's worth it to try and possibly fall in love with"
784,7/27/2015,Nancy T.,dallas-2,4,"I love this place so, so much. I've gone here at least every other week this summer. Started off with single pops but now that I know the flavors better, the 4-pop bag is just a better deal. They even give you an ice pack if you're traveling a bit. I took off a star though because sometimes the fruity flavors are not exactly the most delicious, and the prices are a bit steep for me personally. (Watermelon has been the most deceptive.) But, everything else is great: popsicle quality, service, cleanliness & atmosphere. It even pans out well for a frequent flyer like me because they have punch cards for both single pops and 4-pop bags! And I ACTUALLY reached getting a free popsicle! Never happens anywhere else.The employees are usually younger, college-aged students and generally polite and helpful. It's often changing though so my service can vary from one visit to the next. Nonetheless, I am a happy girl when they remember to punch my card (because I never do)! This place is worth the visit, and most of the times worth the wait. I highly recommend the creamy pops if you're looking for an ice cream feel, but if you're looking for true, icy & fruity pops - fruity is the way to go!"
785,3/22/2015,Alfred L.,dallas-2,3,"Steel City brought to Dallas what they needed.... specialty, boutique popsicles. Be prepared to be amazed by the tastes of having random fruits and strange concoctions. I thought that my experience was okay and the popsicle that I ordered definitely had more flavor and juices. However, considering that a blind taste tester may be unable to differentiate this piece of ice from the ones at Whole Foods, it might just be good for the ""try."" Two stars for the flavor and the juiciness and another one star for the business's attempt to switch up the flavors once in a while.I was slightly perturbed by the prices. For the price of 1 popsicle, I easily felt the pain in my wallet. In a typical popsicle box that you get at the local market, you can paid around $4.69 for 4 similar size and fruity delights, which comes down to $1.17/pop. Overall, Steel City Pops is a rip-off of the Mexican ice cream carts, but offers a lot of vibrant flavors (not the color of the pop though). Granted the hipster-ness of the surrounding area, it shouldn't be too hard to pull $3 from your trust fund."
786,4/15/2015,Kei H.,dallas-2,3,"I love Ice cream, but I didn't like their ice cream at all! A friend of mine told me about this place and how cool it was, so I decided to bring some friends here and try it out. There were a lot of people in line to get some Ice Cream Pop, so I thought ""THEY MUST BE SO GOOD."" My friends got 2 Avocado Milky pops, and I got a ButterMilk pop; and out of our expectation, the ice cream was kinda sour and sweet at the same time which made me feel like I'm eating something ""expired "" already!. We couldn't finish our ice cream tho; they ended up in a trash can. I mean their ice cream doesn't make us happy, but might make someone else happy; so I'll leave them 3 stars for friendly service and cute little place. Just not my type of ice cream,"
787,8/2/2015,Steve C.,dallas-2,5,Delicious fruit popsicle. 3$ seemed a bit but this isn't your regular Popsicle! Real fruit and  chunks. Great treat on a hot Texas evening.
788,10/14/2016,Mimi M.,dallas-2,5,first time trying them. it made my trip to Dallas so much fun. i liked  the different flavors and the atmosphere and i enjoyed watching the people on the back actually making the pops
789,1/19/2015,Jason B.,dallas-2,5,65 degree day in January and me and my girlfriend walked Greenville stopped in for a cool refreshment. Seen other yelpers reviews for this place and was excited to try it. Line out the door is a good thing! So many options I had the coffee dipped in chocolate so good! She had the blueberry cream which was melt in your mouth goodness! Great seating outside and neighborhood vibe is off the chart! Will definitely return to try other flavors!
790,7/22/2015,Rose Y.,dallas-2,5,"Best Popsicles!!! We got the coconut, strawberry, and watermelon, all of which were delicious. We went on a Tuesday, so the line wasn't ridiculous. However, it was still pretty crowded and it was hard to find a comfortable place to stand inside. I wish there was more seating outside, but we had to settle for walking around while our popsicles melted in the sun. Still, great place to hang out with friends and find some respite from the summer heat."
791,5/15/2015,Meghan H.,dallas-2,5,"Staff was friendly, explaining about the store and their model. I opted for a fruity Popsicle (more traditional, water based) and chose Blood Orange. FANTASTIC! Bursting with great flavor and just the right amount of sweetness."
792,6/5/2015,Grace L.,dallas-2,5,This place has a wide selection of pops--creamy and refreshing. I love the cookie pops :) they've partner with unrefined bakery. I also love buttermilk dipped in chocolate!!
793,2/27/2016,Meliha D.,dallas-2,5,"Love this place and I would go there more if it was closer to my house! I have had the coffee (my absolute favorite), coconut (very strong coconut flavor but so good) and buttermilk (tastes like cheesecake). I have tried hibiscus (good), blood orange (not my favorite) and the chocolate cookie dough (I don't know if that's the name but it has chocolate chip cookie dough inside and it's so good)"
794,7/2/2015,Jessica V.,dallas-2,4,"My coworker bought steel city pops to go for a mid day snack and it was wonderful! They packaged all the pops securely so none melted in the Texas heat. I ordered the creamy coconut pop and it was so good! I could tell it was made with fresh ingredients. I can't wait to stop by the store location to try more flavors. I do believe the price point is a bit high for a Popsicle but it's a good treat for certain occasions, I wouldn't go daily though. They packaged all the pops securely so none m"
795,5/29/2015,Christina B.,dallas-2,5,"Went on a Friday night at 9pm. There was a long line out the door but it moved quickly! Got the blackberry yum :) my brother and cousin got strawberry lemonade and chocolate, and they both enjoyed it!"
796,5/29/2015,Morgan S.,dallas-2,3,"Yes, the popsicles were good, but I didn't think they were original. For $3 a popsicle, I want my popsicle to be unlike any other. Unfortunately, my father and I both felt that we were eating the same cream popsicles we get from whole foods. I have tried banana, blackberry, coconut, and chocolate peanut butter.  (We got a bag of them to go). I do like the concept of the freezer bag to go, that was unique."
797,7/12/2015,Joanne V.,dallas-2,3,"Decided to try out the ""famous"" Steel City Pops while we were in town. They have a variety of unique popsicle flavors; fruity or creamy.I got the buttermilk and my boyfriend got the coconut. The buttermilk flavor was interesting. Nice and creamy but at the same time it was also overpowering for my liking. I really liked the coconut flavor, it was creamy and light with shredded coconut. Can't wait to go again and try out different flavors. Good for a hot day!"
798,5/26/2015,Vivian N.,dallas-2,4,"Steel City Pops is a great place to go to when it's warm out. The popsicles contain real fruit and isn't overly sweet. I've tried many of their flavors, but my favorites are the strawberry lemonade and the coffee brownie pops. The strawberry lemonade pop is pretty much self explanatory. It tastes just like strawberry lemonade. The coffee brownie pop contains a brownie core. Surrounding the brownie core, was real coffee ice cream. The only downside was that the pops are pretty expensive. The pops start at $3. We only go here when we are willing to spend a little bit more on popsicles."
799,4/26/2015,Monica A.,dallas-2,5,"Awesome variety and simple ingredients.  One downfall... They don't use stevia or agave... Just organic sugar, even so... Sugar is still sugar! I had the avocado and hubby had coconut... It was very creamy and delish.  I want to try the coffee next time...came recommended.So I ate a sugar free lunch at HG Supply Co. and ruined it with the Popsicle but oh well... It's Sunday!"
800,9/8/2015,Michael B.,dallas-2,5,"Always full of new, fresh , and inventive flavors that don't disappoint! Great location and friendly staff as well!"
801,7/20/2015,Kristen S.,dallas-2,5,"We went on a Monday evening and the line was long but went very fast! They are delicious can't wait to go back and it's in the perfect area too, I love lower Greenville area! Would definitely recommend this place, FYI they only dip them in chocolate if you want in the winter time."
802,12/26/2014,Solomon W.,dallas-2,5,"Sometimes I look at a restaurant or food concept and think ""how did I not come up with this?"" Enter Steel City Pops.This household name started in Birmingham and has showered its sweet iciness all over Texas. And by Texas, I mean Dallas and Fort Worth. But... I hauled 12 popsicles back to Austin. I spent $20 on a cooler and ice. For $30 worth of popsicles. Need I say more about how good these guys are?Alongside a smattering of creamy and traditional options, they also serve philanthropic water. It seems that most trendy food shops now have some humanitarian efforts alongside its MO, and I can appreciate that.Favorites: sweet potato, buttermilk, pineapple jalapeno."
803,10/7/2015,Tabitha B.,dallas-2,5,"LOVE this place! I had the watermelon pop, and my fried had the Caramel one. Her's honestly tasted like eating a Caramel Frap! Mine was so good! Everything a watermelon Popsicle should be : ) if only they could figure out how to get booze in these...;"
804,1/4/2016,Amy A.,dallas-2,5,I want to open one of these in St. Pete! This is the greatest concept and delicious tasting popsicles i've ever had!
805,7/28/2015,Delilah C.,dallas-2,5,"Stand in line.  It doesn't take long at all and this popsicle will literally change your life.My fiancé was running on the Katy Trail when someone from here handed him a popsicle--so he grabbed it and kept running, having no idea that it was going to be the best popsicle he's ever had.  We drove over to their lower greenville location a few days later and wow.  Just, wow.  I got pineapple jalepeno and it's by far the best popsicle I've ever had.  I'm typically an ice cream person but this... this is a game changer.It says they use fresh ingredients and I believe every word of it.  My popsicle was seriously just frozen pineapple.  It even had that texture.  And it had to have been jalapeno juice or zest, because it tasted fresh like the actual pepper and not like a seasoning/sauce.  I can't wait to go back and try more kinds!!!"
806,6/29/2015,J J.,dallas-2,5,Perfect for a hot summer night in Dallas!! Long lines can be deceiving but don't be fooled. I got the Chocolate peanut butter and hubby got strawberry lemonade. Both were so delish!!  Cant wait to try all try flavors! Go in and get yours now!!! Nom nom.
807,1/29/2015,Liz B.,dallas-2,5,Loveeee these pops! The coffee and peanut butter flavored are my favorite! Plus you can get them dipped in chocolate! Definitely a fun treat in Dallas and Fort Worth!
808,4/2/2016,Birney F.,dallas-2,3,"The pops were amazing. However, we spent 30 minutes trying to find parking. This issue, most definitely, should be adressed. I recommend the blueberry cream pop and the vanilla chocolate chip cookie cream pop. If they had a banana pop, I would be delighted. Though the pops were fantastic, the lack of parking hindered the full experience. Go Stars."
809,12/13/2015,Em C.,dallas-2,5,Delicious! Me and my friend have wanted to try this place since summer but never got around to it we tried it today though and they did not disappoint! Plus no long lines since it's winter. We tried eggnog and gingerbread cheesecake we both enjoyed our popsicles. My eggnog popsicle tasted juts like a glass of eggnog and was creamy and full of flavor I could taste the cinnamon and nutmeg in it. The girl helping us was super nice and helpful too. Service was quick we will be coming back to try other flavors.
810,9/27/2016,Karen G.,dallas-2,5,I hired Steel City Pops to cater 150 pops at my daughters recent Bat Mitzvah. The pops were delicious and very well received by guests but my biggest surprise was getting an email from the catering manager that only 123 of my 150 pops were eaten and asking whether I'd like a store credit or REFUND for the difference. I was so pleasantly surprised by this offer - as no other caterer that I've ever worked with has offered anything of the sort! I opted for the refund and received a check yesterday. I would highly recommend SCP for any event. Both kids and adults loved the flavors and they were extremely easy to work with. It was a hit!
811,10/14/2014,April S.,dallas-2,5,"I'm not really a big popsicle fan, or a fan of cold desserts in general (blasphemy, I know!), but I love Steel City Pops! The only reason I decided to try this place out was that I'm an Alabama girl and this is an Alabama franchise. We don't have a lot of franchises, so I try to support whenever I can. Thank goodness Steel City Pops is totally worthy!There are the fruity ones on the left of the menu, which are... fruity, and not cream-based. On the right of the menu are the creamy varieties, and that's where I have spent my money. So far I've had the creamy lemon TWICE and this last visit I tried the cherry sour cream while my mom bought the carrot cake pop. All have been amazing. There are more adventurous flavors like buttermilk and avocado, but I'm only mildly adventurous and I just haven't made the jump yet. One day! The pops taste so amazingly fresh, and for $3 a pop? I'll take it! Apparently everyone else will too, 'cause there's always a line. Fear not! The line moves pretty quickly, and I've made friends each time I've visited. Everyone likes to discuss what they're going to get and what they've had before and it's an awesome community atmosphere. Don't forget to get a loyalty punch card!"
812,5/31/2015,Andy P.,dallas-2,5,"Usually, I'm not a sweets guy but WOW! This place is really good. So good that I ordered another one after trying my friends and finishing up with my mine. Hands down, creamy Strawberry is my favorite! Even real strawberries don't taste that good. They use real fruit for everything even passion fruit and usually that's only in syrupt form. I had the creamy coconut as well and I love it!If I'm ever in Dallas ever again, I have to go back there. The place is pretty small, but they're very quick and efficient. What's more interesting is that they have 0 powder stuff for their popsicles. There are also exotic flavors like guava, passion fruit, and other different combinations. Great place for a hot weather day in Dallas, and I can't wait to come back for this place!"
813,7/13/2015,Sarah P.,dallas-2,5,"Love steel city pops in Greenville. Great location! Had the strawberry lemonade, vanilla bean and avocado flavor and they're all really amazing!"
814,8/14/2015,Natasha M.,dallas-2,5,"First time here and I loved the vibe, the people and the popsicles were delicious!! I had the lime one"

Updated review",Lily L.,dallas-2,4,A lot of people hyped up this place so I decided to try it. I felt bold and order the avocado cream flavor but was very disappointed. It tasted nothing like avocado. Instead it tasted like guacamole drenched in lime. The only reason why I still rate this place with four star is because I was able to try the flavored that my friends got and they were so good. It is very pricey for what you're getting but it's still worth a first time try.

Updated review",Rosy H.,dallas-2,4,"Okay, Steel City Pops, I misjudged you. Maybe it's because I got a fruity pop, and the creamy ones are to go for instead. Because I tried a pumpkin and a butter pecan, and now I just want more.You win. Congratulations. You can celebrate by giving snaps to yourself."
817,5/19/2015,Leah B.,dallas-2,5,"I love steel city pops.Current favorite flavors are the green tea, orange, and mint (tastes like a nonalcoholic mojito of sorts) and their papaya/guava flavor!My only complaint is it is one pretty dang expensive popsicle. But it is delicious!"
818,6/11/2015,Annie T.,dallas-2,5,"This is the stuff dreams are made of.  If you ever find yourself on Lower Greenville, you need to stop in and grab heaven on a stick.  I've probably had more than I needed from SCP, but it was worth every penny!  Flavors to try Coffee (if you like Vietnamese Cafe Su Da, this is a winner), Avocado (creamy, yumminess with a nice splash of lime), Orange Mint Green Tea (perfect for these hot summer days), Pineapple Jalepeno (sweet & spicy!), and Strawberry Lemonade (you can't go wrong with this).  This is the real deal!"
819,5/31/2015,Lily L.,dallas-2,4,"Second time here and first for my bf. I really enjoyed their ice pops because it's all natural, very juiceful, and had the right amount of fruit shavings. For the bf he said it didn't live up to the hype, and tasted like the Fruttare brand from Albertson's that could feed 6 people for the price of one SCP... Location was also a plus since it was a min walking distance from Trader Joe's and nice restaurant bars."
820,6/24/2015,Mel N.,dallas-2,5,"This place was packed when we walked in, and there was a long line, but it doesn't take long at all to get to the counter.It's nice and clean inside, and every popsicle you try is totally worth those $3 and however long it took you to find a parking spot.We got one cantaloupe, one passion fruit, and one coffee brownie pop. They were all so good, we wished we had a cooler to bring some back home to houston with us.The first bite of your popsicle is HEAVEN, and you STAY THERE until you finish it.The pops didn't start melting until about maybe 5 minutes later, but still held their shape.Next time, I'm going to try all the pops. ALL THE POPS."
821,8/3/2014,Jimmy-lee B.,dallas-2,5,"Like a horse to water, I was drawn to this hot new Popsicle Mecca.After passing by this lower Greenville storefront many times, I had to partake. The long lines and Popsicle hungry zombies standing around, peeked my inner fat kids interest. My only regret is that I waited so long.What an awesome new concept for Dallas! The only thing hotter than Steele City Pops, is the surface of the sun.Yes, the line can be a bit overwhelming. However, the reward will not disappoint.Choices.... Choices. So many icy cold options left me with no choice but to purchase the four for $10 deal.I devoured the vanilla bean option before a single drop melted! Perhaps the best vanilla Popsicle on Earth! My partner slowly enjoyed the avocado pop, until I decided it tasted like key lime pie and almost took off his finger in a moment of mania!Knowing two other options( peanut butter and strawberry) remained inside our thermal carry out bag, I hurried to the car. This fat kid needed the exercise!The store itself is simple. The many options are not. Staff is friendly and helpful. They even unwrapped my little treasure for me! Asked me ""how far are you traveling"" I guess this was to help them pack my extras in a thermal bag or styrofoam cooler. WOW!I'm in. I'm sold on this place! I feel sorry for the many people who walked by, saw the line, and left. Forgive them Popsicle gods for they know not what they missed!!!Crap! Now I'm hungry. Wonder what time the open?"
822,8/26/2014,Tania P.,dallas-2,5,"Dear D Magazine,Please take a moment to review your selection of Best Ice Cream in Dallas. While Carnival Barker is kitschy and started as a food truck, Steel City Pops has the same background - and can actually deliver excellent ice cream. While $3 is kinda cray for a popsicle, I happily fork it over for their great product. The coconut flavor is actually made of coconut milk; creamy, decadent, full-bodied coconut dream. The buttermilk is frozen cheesecake. Watermelon and Blood Orange is pure fruit on a stick. This is how flavors should work. Not only do they taste as promised, they also managed to use pure ingredients so it's like the frozen version of those flavors - not fake aromas. There is always a long line - so that should tell you something. It's fast-moving, and mostly due to patrons standing around blocking the doorway - presumably so they can get another one shortly after finishing their first. You can get 4 for $10. Husband and I almost double fisted it.On top of this, they have friendly, unpretentious, un-jaded employees. *FIST BUMP* I invite you to try a few flavors. Hell, I will buy them for you.Love, Tania"
823,1/31/2016,Arman K.,dallas-2,5,"Yum!!!! Ok, so yeah it's a Popsicle so don't get it twisted, BUT this is a flavorful and delicious frozen treat. The name in my opinion adds some effect to the Popsicle (it's called STEEL city I mean Steel..........like you get the picture). My all time favorite is the hibiscus and I need to give a few others an opportunity. Pomegranate is good too. They have ice based and Milk based so there is a little variety there plus the flavors. Be prepared to wait as the line for this place feels like it is long year round."
824,2/8/2015,Joanna T.,dallas-2,4,"We tried the avocado one and it tasted more like key lime pie.. We also tried their new vanilla brownie cake pop and it was delicious! It's exactly what it says, an actually brownie covered in vanilla icecream. The brownie is also soy and gluten free!"
825,10/29/2014,Thy T.,dallas-2,4,"This place has a longer line compared to the one in Fort Worth but I am guessing it's due to the location plus it's been here longer. I love the pumpkin creamy popsicle as well as the mocha. Wasn't too huge of a fan of their pomegranate or rhubarb. They have a lot of different flavors which can make deciding on something nearly impossible. I love watching people sighting while eating ice cream since there are plenty of people in that area. Overall, I love their creamy ice creams and will continue coming back!"
826,9/11/2015,M. B.,dallas-2,5,"Steel city pops... what have you done? You are undoing  my workouts! This is what normally happens... My husband and I both eat one there. Then, we bring home a 12 pack.  I personally recommend the cookie pops. They are $4.50/pop vs the regular pops which are $3/pop. The chocolate brownie and vanilla chocolate chip are definitely my favorites. It's smooth and creamy, but soft and chewy at the same time.  I've had the strawberry lemonade before and it was a little too sweet for me. Cantaloupe... not the greatest. Blah! The texture is off.  Coffee is ok.  I can't wait to try other flavors!  Maybe the next one on the list is buttermilk. Heard it's delish... :-).There's a few parking spaces (parallel parking) right up front. You can also park in the back if you are lucky enough to find a spot during peak hours. If you have trouble finding this place... it's right across Trader Joe's.  Happy eating :-)."
827,2/17/2016,Karan K.,dallas-2,4,Really great popsicles. The lines are usually pretty long here but it's always worth the wait. They have a ton of interesting and fun flavors. My personal favorite is the brownie fudge popsicle. Come here if you want to have a popping time.
828,8/8/2014,Robyn B.,dallas-2,2,"While I will always be indifferent because I was a regular at Zubar and wish they would've used the huge inside space better, the pops are decent, I wish the chocolate was more like a pudding pop!  That would be amazing!  The $1 drinks  and local talent vs the $3 pops and strangers everywhere... I don't know. I walk by daily with my dog (it's on her route) and it is great to see the flood of people reviving the area.  With people comes more trash unfortunately,  I am appalled to see morning staff power-washing their tiny patio (where I've had some of the best conversations in my life) while I am sticking to the sidewalk across the street and watching birds play with littered pop sticks.  Any available public seating on the block is sticky with pop drips and the sidewalks are all stained.  It is difficult me to welcome you to my neighborhood if you are going to treat it this way. Your lines are blocking foot traffic and there is clearly not enough space for patrons to enjoy your pops without trashing the neighborhood.  This will keep me from coming back until you fix this problem.  Best of luck."
829,10/3/2014,Nilesh C.,dallas-2,4,"There are very few places worthy enough to have their distinct identity and yet be successful. Steel City Pops is one of them.Pros:1. Unique Pop flavors. From creamy to fruity. Wide variety to choose from.2. Good ambiance of the area its located in.3. Friendly staff.Cons:1. Parking is just madness.2. Serving portion is so huge that by the end of the eating it, you are just finishing it and not loving it. The happiness quotient decreases rapidly after half of the popsicle. 3. Pricey but hey that's what gourmet food is about.All in all, definitely a go to place for more than normal occasions. But not sure if I will go  here every time I have a craving for popsicle."
830,2/1/2016,Jianbo G.,dallas-2,5,Awesome place! They change flavors according to different seasons. It's nice to hold a pop and talk a walk around the neighborhood at night.
831,9/29/2015,Justin S.,dallas-2,4,The line of tweens is always intimidating but stick with it...it's speedy. Have three or four extra dollars and you're walking home? Grab one. They're delicious.
832,1/16/2015,Tracy R.,dallas-2,5,"Whenever I'm checking out the local restaurants and bars on Greenville, I always crave the pops from Steel City. I absolutely love this place! They make the pops there (you can even see the kitchen in back where they have huge machines to make them). I always get the coffee-flavored pop, which is one of their more popular flavors. It's so creamy and it's not too sweet! It never disappoints. The cool thing about this place is that you can replace your popsicle free-of-charge if you don't like it. I remember getting the avocado the first time I went and I didn't like it too much. The staff was incredibly nice and gave me a new flavor. Really cool policy!"
833,1/5/2016,Esther R.,dallas-2,4,Best popsicles here! My fav is the Coffee one! I love the coffee powder topping thing at the top!!!! I can taste the real creaminess and I love creamy ice cream and made with fresh ingredients!
834,5/19/2015,Trang N.,dallas-2,4,"$3 for a stick of ice cream. Its a little bit pricy. It likes they make smoothie and then put it in frozen with its stick. I love something which is sour, then the strawberry lemonade is great for me. Service was fast, cashiers are very nice."
835,6/11/2015,Brittany W.,dallas-2,5,"Steel City Pops ROCKS.  Small straightforward storefront allows you to walk in, choose your flavor from the huge menu above, and order.  They take the pop out of the cooler right in front of you and take the wrapper off as well.  The menu changes daily, and all the recipes are gourmet, creative, and made right there in the kitchen.  Staff is nice too.  Never met a steel city pop i didn't like.  My faves are coffee, and cantaloupe.  I've been meaning to try the avocado pop."
836,11/23/2014,Mona B.,dallas-2,4,Steel City Pops lives up to they hype! I would recommend the carrot cake pops - its creamy and delicious and even has some pecans! The strawberry pop is probably one of the healthier ones with just 71 calories and has real strawberries. You can even get the pops dipped in chocolate! They use coconut oil so the chocolate has a hint of the coconut flavor - good add-on for the strawberry pop! For coffee lovers the coffee pop is equally good and has real espresso in it - new way to get your caffeine in!
837,8/28/2014,Dean R.,dallas-2,5,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.  I'm the last person to discover this little portal into heaven.  But, I feel compelled to add my voice to the chorus of rave reviews.  As a life-long Texan, I spend my summers searching for remedies from the brutal heat.  So, on a day where you spend a great deal of time pondering the actually boiling point of brains, it's a near life-saver to stroll into Steel City Pops for an instant and delicious cool-me-down. And Oh Em Gee, the flavors!  Folks, these are not your grocery store ""popsicles"", which are pretty much frozen sugar-water on sticks.  Bleah.  No, these are deep frozen gourmet concoctions that rival any ice-cream joint in the city.  I've had a Pineapple Jalapeno that made me want to have a cigarette after...and I don't smoke.  Today, I had the Strawberry Cream, and I was instantly hurled back along the chronological age line to a birthday party for a girl I had a crush on in 6th grade, where they served pink cake and ice cream.  Both were heavy, rich, and extremely pulpy.  And OH SO flavorful!  Don't like what you see on the menu?  Come back another day, as they continually rotate flavors. Wow.  I've now been twice, and already feel like I need to find a Pops Anonymous group.  I don't care how long it takes you to find a parking spot, get your face over to Steel City Pops.  You'll change the name of that orifice between your chin and your nose to ""My Steel City Pops Hole""."
838,12/28/2015,Davis V.,dallas-2,5,"Steel city pops is a one of a kind place. Can't really find any other places in Texas that specializes in popsicles. This place offers unique and great flavors you can't just get at the frozen isle at your local krogers or Walmart. The best flavor I would have to say is the raisin rum. It's nice and sweet and you can taste a hint of rum in it. It's definitely a must try. My friends had the sweet tea. If you're a person that orders sweet tea where ever you go, that's the one for you."
839,7/16/2014,Diana D.,dallas-2,4,Buttermilk is creamy and tastes like a yogurt Popsicle. Banana Popsicle had hints of cinnamon and sugar and is quite delightful. Lines are long but fast. In n out in 10 min max. Not bad for $3 cool down. I wish I had come up with this business plan first! Parking and traffic sucks in the area so it makes me hesitant to go back or make it a destination spot unless I'm already in the area.
840,10/6/2015,Matt P.,dallas-2,5,"I'm honestly surprised that there is anything less than 5 star reviews on here. Haven't been disappointed by anything I've had here. The people leaving reviews about paying too much for popcicle need to stick to their McDonald's sundaes and get out of line so that rest of us can order the dessert on the stick goodness. Little insight, HG Sply will allow you to take Steel City Pops into their establishment next door if you prefer to enjoy your pop with a view and an adult beverage."
841,7/24/2014,Esther H.,dallas-2,3,"I'm not sure if I just came on a day that was just a little lackluster but I don't see what the hype is on Steel City Pops. Sure it's a great convenient place if you want a single cold refreshing popsicle but I just think for $3 you could go to Trader Joe's literally across the street and get a box of them for roughly the same cost. It's one of those cute places you should bring a date to after you've had a meal. With an itty bitty space and a huge following of people, Steel City Pops is kind of crowded but its a definite come and go space. You choose between a creamy or fruity type of popsicle. Opting for something a little more fruity, I chose the Hibiscus. It's a lot more sweet than citrusy and the color is a rich merlot hue. If I could just eat colors I would! I've also tried the strawberry and it is down right a good classic tasting just like strawberries. The reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I feel like this place could really push the presentation. I see people making crazy flavors mixing different unique tastes but Steel City Pops played it pretty safe. And if they made their molds more unique for cool shapes like rockets or flowers I think they would really bring popsicle places to the forefront of dessert shops."
842,6/11/2014,I W.,dallas-2,5,"I live in Plano and twice in one week I've driven to Greenville to get a popsicle because they're just that good. Steel Pop has a menu of fruity and creamy pops. They can be purchased individually or in packs of four (assorted however you prefer). They are packaged in a freezer bag that's designed to keep them cold until you get home. Although the prices are more expensive than what is sold in a store their pops are made with ingredients that you'll recognize and can pronounce (avocado, hibiscus, cucumber, blood oranges).  They are pretty popular so you'll find people (families, singles, groups) hanging out on the front patio or inside.  During both visits there were short lines but they moved quickly. I've tried both the hibiscus and blood orange flavors and my absolute favorite is the hibiscus. The beautiful color and intense flavor are wonderful, joys to my senses. During both visits the staff was super friendly and efficient.  TiP! They offer a loyalty card that you can get stamped to earn free pops."
843,8/31/2014,Joy H.,dallas-2,5,"Love Steel City! I try a new flavor every time I go and for the most part, they are delicious and refreshing. The peach is a little too sweet and tastes too much like the syrup from a can of peaches..kind of artificial tasting, but I've really enjoyed the other one's I've had-blueberry basil, watermelon, blood orange, strawberries&cream, sweet tea, avocado. Great place along Lower Greenville-definitely check it out! I love bringing out of towners here because the area has so much to offer-you could grab lunch/dinner at one of the many places along this street and then drop by for some popsicles or skip the meal and go straight for dessert."
844,9/26/2015,Thuy B.,dallas-2,4,They have a very large selection of flavors and it's a fun place to take kids or get something cold and refreshing. My favorite is the coconut. I wouldn't recommend the avocado tho. They use lime to keep the green color and it masks the avocado flavor.
845,9/6/2014,Heather S.,dallas-2,5,FRIENDLY STAFF and DELICIOUS POPSICLES! I will definitely be back! What a great concept! I can't wait for more flavors to try- being sober it's a great place to go and hang with my husband without having to eat a meal. The hangout area is cute and very family friendly for our daughter. I will still always feel awkward licking a Popsicle in public past the age of 7 but I'll get over that soon enough! ;)
846,7/30/2015,Jade S.,dallas-2,5,"BEST Popsicle around.Steel City pops has a variety of dfferent flavors made of real fruit. They also just came out with cookie pops that have cookie inside of them. Traveling far from home? No worries they provide you with bags to keep the pops cold. You can also buy them 12 at a time, mix and match your favorite.Peanut butter, avocado, just to name a few.Also a great place to stop if your walking around Greenville."
847,9/27/2014,Andrew L.,dallas-2,5,"Discovered this place after coming out of Teppo months ago for their grand opening. They were giving out free popsicle flyers which is what got me hooked. Pretty much all of their flavors are good, but their avocado and coconut are ridiculously good. Their avocado isn't a straightforward avocado since it's got plenty of lime in it. As amazing as the avocado is, I think I like the coconut even better. It's got bits of toasted coconut in it and the flavor is similar in flavor to the coconut topping of a certain Vietnamese dessert if you know what I'm talking about. It's simply amazing stuff."
848,10/20/2015,Oleta R.,dallas-2,5,Love their popsicles! I can't have dairy but there a few fruit options to choose from. It can get pretty packed inside but service is pretty fast. Great price!

Updated review",Kelly Y.,dallas-2,5,They now have Pops with a frozen Choco Chip cookie or Brownie So Good! The menu also has calories included next to each pop now too!
850,7/6/2015,Paul R.,dallas-2,5,"This is a unique and one of a kind Dallas staple. You can't go anywhere else in town for the type of pops they serve here. The cream pops are just impressive. I most recently had the coffee one, and it was wonderful. Sampling the jalapeno-pineapple was a real treat as well. It can't be beat if you're in the neighborhood on a hot day, which happens a lot here in Texas. Any Dallas resident owes it to themselves to give Steel City Pops a try at least once."
851,7/1/2014,Alice L.,dallas-2,5,So much yums in a popsicle! I like how this place offers a wide variety of flavors from fruity to creamy. I had such a hard time deciding what to get but the employee there recommended the strawberry balsamic. So delicious! It tasted like a more tart strawberry but very rich and fresh! I also tried some of the coffee pop and it was so good that I might just have to get that next time. Awesome place for a quick dessert!
852,5/19/2014,Afomia H.,dallas-2,5,"As my friend and I were engrossed in a deep conversation on the patio of Mudsmith, we noticed in our peripheral a series of contented pedestrians carrying what appeared to be ice-cream bars. By the relatively intact nature of the bars, and lack of excessive dripping, we came to the conclusion that it must be a shop on this very strip.After about the 12 person passed our table, we finally broke and asked where they had acquired these popsicles. ""It's a new store! Just there, you've gotta try it"" said an enthusiastic youth. ""I got the Sweet Tea popsicle! It takes like SWEET TEA!"" he said, still in awe.Frankly, the kid's overt excitement sealed the deal for us. We decided to check it out, hoping the store will match the hype. We approached the entrance. A helpful employee at the counter explained the history of the shop for us.  Good on Steel City for keeping well informed staff, especially in this early phase. ""All of our pops are made in store,"" he said as he pointed to a spotless kitchen behind him. He went on to tell us about the two different types of popicles they sold: cream based (like chocolate, coffee, peanut butter) and water based (the fruity flavors). I chose Vanilla Bean and my friend Lauren decided on the Blueberry Basil. It was moderately priced ($3 per pop.) I took my first lick and my high expectations were exceeded. This was the richest, most creamy piece of vanilla ice cream I have ever had in my life. Lauren agreed when we traded pops. I was rather weary of her Blueberry Basil at first, but it was simply refreshing! The store offers a myriad of interesting flavors that I cannot wait to try.I highly recommend you give this shop a try."
853,7/6/2014,Emily Y.,dallas-2,5,Tasty and convenient idea! Won't complain about the price either bc I would pay just as much for a drink or dessert that is about the same enjoyment. Line may seem long but it goes down pretty quickly.We got the fruity strawberry and milky avocado. The strawberry was just a typical but delicious strawberry fruit bar. No complaints but don't expect anything other than a fruit bar. The avocado was milky but definitely more lime flavor than anything. I was prepared for this bc of past reviews. I think they should rename it avocado lime. Both were refreshing and I would try more flavors next time. Definitely an alternative to the standard ice cream or dessert. I would recommend giving this place a try.Parking is the only minor downside. Nothing unexpected on lower Greenville though.
854,8/19/2014,Hai Yen N.,dallas-2,4,Been here twice and I really like the concept. Popsicles always bring back a sense of nostalgia to when you were younger and waiting for the ice cream truck to come to your street. These are more healthy and flavorful. I've had the hibiscus which is made without milk. Tastes like pomegranate with a hint of citrus. It's 2/3 sweet and 1/3 sour. The watermelon is refreshing and very light. The blackberry is delicious but because they leave all the seeds in there it took away from the wonderful flavor. I think overall I prefer their milk based or creamy pops better. The strawberries and cream was delicious and more smooth and fun to eat.If I'm in the area I'll definitely be back but probably won't go out of my way since parking can be a pain in that area.
855,7/12/2015,Lauren B.,dallas-2,5,"Obsessed with this place! My husband and I are out here from California and our hotel doesn't have a freezer but we typically get the 4 pack of pops and scarf them down. He loves the vanilla and brownie pop. The first visit I got the green tea with orange and it was great! Lots of true green tea flavor with the twist of citrus. The blood orange was my favorite of the fruity ones. It was so juicy and had great flavor! The passion fruit one was ok, just not as juicy as I hoped it would be. The buttermilk was amazing! I read a review that said it was like a slightly sour cream cheese with sweet vanilla tones and that's exactly what it was like! We will be making as many trips back as we can until we go back home. I will miss it when we leave :("
856,7/18/2015,Phoebe C.,dallas-2,5,"I'm a sucker for sweets so it's no surprise that Steel City Pops hits a home run for me. When my boyfriend and I visited, we were super lucky that there was no line (I've been in that area and seen the line out the door before!). Normally, I'm a big fruit flavor kind of girl but that night I was craving something sweet and chocolate. To my surprise and delight, Steel City Pops not only offers a variety of delicious fruit combinations, they also have cookie pops! Delicious combination of sweet and savory with cookies OR BROWNIES in between. My boyfriend and I both for the vanilla brownie cookie pop and after the first bite... Heaven in my mouth. It's a must try and I will definitely have to stop by to try the fruity flavors as well!"

Updated review",Ally N.,dallas-2,4,"Disregard my previous review. Steel City Pops has earned my approval. I clean around the area and decided to stop by with a group of friends after shopping. We ordered the chocolate, vanilla bean, ""divinity"" and white chocolate. Yes, I said it folks, white chocolate. My heart skipped a beat when I saw the new flavors. Most of friends loved their flavors (well one was iffy about the chocolate and said it was sour?¿). The cashier was super friendly and the place was overall very clean. Love the service, love the pops and love the location.I only wish this place closed later. I always end up wanting to go here after 10 pm."
858,6/23/2016,Billy E.,dallas-2,4,"Unique flavors and very good; was skeptical about a ""popsicle"" or ""ice pop"" but ended up getting 2 because the first one was so good and there were so many flavors I wanted to try. Workers were courteous and helpful. The pops are affordable too - about $3 I believe."
859,2/14/2015,Cja L.,dallas-2,4,"Great place to stop by with your sweet tooth friends. This time I got the cookie chip ice cream but it might have been too sweet of a choice for me. Try lemonade or cucumber lime!Ice cream was good but employees are even better. We stopped by right before closing and sat inside until after their closing time. We didn't realize because there was no rush from their side, employees were nothing but sweet.Gotta love their 'to go' thermal bags. Ask for one if you can manage not eating their ice cream right away!"
860,10/25/2014,Debra T.,dallas-2,5,"One of my favorite places EVER in Dallas. Steel City Pops makes their own fresh pops from local, organic ingredients. Best of all, their pops are gluten-free! I love how they are always changing their menu and adding new flavors so every visit is a new experience at Steel City Pops! So far, my absolute favorite is their Pumpkin although I know this is only a seasonal flavor. If you are obsessed with all things pumpkin like me, I would try that before it is too late!"
861,9/30/2015,Amanda C.,dallas-2,4,"Amazing popsicles, coconut and avocado are the bomb. Coconut is perfectly creamy complimented with actual coconut shavings on the bottom. Avocado was delicious and complimented well with lime taste as well. Line is always long at the store front though, especially in the summer of course! Try to find their little pop-up cart at places like The Porch on Tuesdays!"
862,7/10/2014,Matt D.,dallas-2,5,"I didn't know that my family's bloodline had an addictive gene until I tasted my first Steel City Pop. As I ate my Pineapple Jalapeno popsicle, all of life's worries floated away. Had I known that for just $2.77 + tax all of my problems would vanish, I would have captured this obsession long ago.DRIVE to 2012 Greenville Ave in Dallas.PARK for free along the road.WALK under the wooden patio featuring outdoor seating.ORDER your heaven on a stick.EAT it.SMILE.REPEAT DAILY.The selections are incredible. The staff is friendly. The pops are killer!Why are you still reading this? GO!NOW!"
863,7/2/2014,Katie A.,dallas-2,5,"Great service - quick and friendly. They offer an insulated bag with an gel-ice pack if you are traveling 20-30 minutes away.The flavors are wonderful. We especially liked the gluten-free and vegan flavors, though you should ask about dairy content if you are lactose-intolerant.We tried watermelon, sweet tea, coconut and sour cream cherry. Cannot wait to come back and try some other flavors!"
864,5/24/2014,Emily C.,dallas-2,4,"My name is Emily C. and I have a problem. I have an addiction to frozen desserts.That's why Steel City Pops poses a serious threat to my wallet. Seeing the menu of unique flavors, I already know I will be back to try more. And at $3 a popsicle...well let's just say those 5 minutes of icy goodness will come at a cost.They have creamy popsicles and fruity ones. The day we went, we were both not feeling the creamy, and tried the hibiscus and cucumber line off the ""fruity"" side. The hibiscus (recommended by the staff) was so refreshing on a hot day. The cucumber lime was didn't taste as I expected - it was more cucumber-y, but had a unique taste that grew on you as you kept eating it. Almost pickle-like at moments, yet super refreshing.There was a line that went quickly, and plenty of people enjoying their popsicles on the benches outside.Parking can be tricky, as always in this area during peak times, but there are several lots in the surrounding areas."
865,11/11/2014,Mussaab H.,dallas-2,3,I'm not really a big popsicle fan so take what I say with a grain of salt. I had never been before but heard a lot of good things so I decided to give it a try one late Saturday night. I tried the fruit flavors and got an Arnold Palmer. It definitely tasted like one but I found myself just wanting to be done with it about half-way through. It's not like it tasted bad or anything. It was actually pretty good but it just wasn't very fulfilling. I think I'll go back and try one of the creamy flavors. I recommend trying this place at least once in your life. Its a pretty cool concept even if you aren't into popsicles.
866,3/22/2015,Lauren M.,dallas-2,5,"A designer popsicle joint that isn't over-priced, AKA a little slice of heaven.Located in the up-and-coming area that is lower-Greenville, this little shop is not only extremely efficient at getting through long lines, but offers a huge array of awesome popsicles. From buttercream and coffee, to strawberry balsamic and avocado, this place has a flavor for everyone. If you want a little more substance, you can also go for one of their new cookie pops, which I haven't tried personally but my friends adore. For Weight Watchers like myself, I was also surprised and happy to see their website also offers all of their nutritional information! Parking can be a little difficult during the dinner hours, but there is a rather large lot behind the establishment. All in all, it's more fun and cheaper than getting fro-yo and much more unique.Menu Recommendation: Coffee Popsicle"
867,9/17/2014,Elain L.,dallas-2,3,"I had high expectations as I heard so many great reviews about the place! But I must be honest and say it was a bit overhyped. I'm a sweet tooth and I love ice cream/ice pops, but Steel City Pops was just okay. I had the avocado ice pop, which didn't even taste like avocado. It tasted more like lime and it was very tart. It should've been called a lime ice pop. My friends who were with me who tried blood orange and strawberry didn't find anything special about their pops. Parking was also hard to find as it was in the middle of west 7th area. Despite of it, the place looked nice and you can see them making the ice pops..."
868,5/29/2014,Christopher D.,dallas-2,5,"Amazing popsicles and excellent service.  They cut open the popsicle wrapper for you.  The manager is really nice and knowledgable, you can tell he cares about the brand.The flavors are very unique.  Blood Orange and Avocado are really good.  Wish they would stay open a little later!"
869,10/6/2014,David L.,dallas-2,5,"Steel City aims to do for popsicles what others have done for tacos, froyo, cupcakes, and pie. They've already made it big in the Steel City, and they're showing every sign of succeeding here. Everything is of course gourmet and homemade. There isn't much room inside for sitting, but the kitchen is exposed as at Dude Sweet Chocolate and Emporium Pies. Their extensive list of flavors, some exotic and some familiar, rotates regularly. Yes, you can get a whole box of popsicles for $3, but the high end popsicle isn't all hype. You'll be able to taste the difference."
870,7/12/2015,Dixon W.,dallas-2,3,Good product but inattentive staff. They sent me home with buttermilk instead of vanilla bean for literally the second time this month. It's really frustrating wanting to enjoy my sweet treat and getting a mouthful of sour buttermilk.
871,9/1/2014,Jonathan Z.,dallas-2,3,"It's in a good location which helps its appeal - but I think some flavors are hit or miss. So far, I've tried:1) pineapple jalapeno - Interesting combination, however, they did not achieve the perfect balance of the 2 flavors - it was soooooooo sweet and also really spicy. I did not want to finish2) vanilla bean - sounds real simple, but it was completely satisfying - imagine a heavenly cloud of vanilla melting in your mouthI still want to try the avocado, strawberry cream, and coffee."
872,7/25/2014,Tammy T.,dallas-2,3,"I really love the idea of this place but we tried 3 different ice-cream bars but it was all meh. We ordered watermelon, bloody orange and strawberry. It's kind of bland and not as fruity as I would have wanted it to be. It's not like a WOW that's good. My least fav was the watermelon because it was too icy. I would come back to try their other stuff though because the idea is really cute and fun to have an ice cream shop."
873,8/17/2014,Jay L.,dallas-2,3,"Its a Popsicle. I had the watermelon. It was good, not great, but good. I may go again to try another flavor."
874,7/23/2014,Chereen P.,dallas-2,5,"Everything from the popsicle to their bathrooms rocked. The line may extend out to the street, but don't fret it goes by fast. While you're standing in line you're going to kick yourself for not starting your own popsicle business sooner. Like, hasta la Vista cake balls... See ya never! I love the Popsicles because the ingredients taste natural and fresh. For example, the banana popsicle consists of a banana and a dash of cinnamon. I'm pretty sure all they did was smash the banana and freeze it... And it was awesome. Oh and if you're on a date don't get the blueberry basil because you will get blueberry skin stuck in between your teeth. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."
875,7/1/2015,Skeptical G.,dallas-2,5,"If you have seen ""When Harry Met Sally,"" you can guess what my reaction was to my first taste of the Yogurt flavored pop. But I didn't have to fake my reaction the way Sally did, because it really was that good. (And, if yogurt was good, then eggnog was spectacular.) I am in a race to ""run every flavor of the menu"" with my friend Jane. Fabulous."
876,10/7/2015,George H.,dallas-2,4,Cake pops were out when I visited but the chocolate dip game was in full force. Will definitely return to try more flavors. I tried the coffee dipped in chocolate and couldn't have been happier.
877,8/10/2014,Brixton P.,dallas-2,5,This place has awesome homemade pops.  You can find a line out the door on a Friday/Saturday evening. What a great concept!  Kudos to the owners of this joint.
878,6/1/2016,Jane L.,dallas-2,5,"I genuinely enjoyed Steel City. There was a bit of a line when I got there, but the prices are not completely ridiculous, as many ""gentrified"" establishments seem to be. It was a cute and fun place to enjoy some quality summer time."
879,10/18/2014,Sylvia H.,dallas-2,5,Omg!!! Best pops on earth try the maple bacon bourbon you can't go wrong!! I will drive 3 hours for this lol!
880,7/24/2014,Joey T.,dallas-2,3,"Sorry not a fan. Tried the watermelon, strawberry, and peach fruity pops and I was not wow by it. The ice cream tastes very similar to those mexican ice cream carts. Three stars for the organic, gluten-free, and vegetarian ice cream.  $3 each is a fair price."
881,5/29/2016,Donella K.,dallas-2,4,great unique flavors we enjoyed; FAV was jalapeno pineapple - although my BFF liked the cookie pops best.  One on greenville - parking lot in back; Casa Linda easy to get into and park.
882,7/13/2014,Jinny C.,dallas-2,5,"(COLD) Dessert shops in Dallas?!?! Finally!!!It's ingenious to put one right in lower Greenville since people actually DO walk around down there. The Texas heat is still unbearable so this fancy little popsicle shop is basically giving us strollers no choice but to go get an ice cold popsicle!After a nice lunch from HG sply, my guy and I were walking past this newly opened place bustling with people. I figured it was a restaurant but everyone had a popsicle! I was like... Wait, ARE THEY GIVING OUT FREE POPSICLES?! Clearly I was confused haha they had just opened a couple of days ago at that time. The sign is easy to miss when you're walking about. I got in and only then did I discover their heavenly ""fruity or creamy"" $3 popsicles!So to break it down, one side of the store is fruity and the other is creamy. The flavors are not as weird as Lick in Austin, but some are interesting.. Like blueberry basil, which I have yet to try. I got blood orange on my first visit. And IT WAS GOOOOOOOOOD. It was gone so quickly though! But I did what I had to do to beat the heat. OH and it was such a pleasant surprise to see them at Midnight at the Nasher! It's an arts district block party but it was SO nice to see their small stand (seriously small- 3 fruity flavors and 3 creamy flavors) inside Nasher's backyard! I immediately purchased a couple, banana and the cherry sour cream, and I was in heaven once again. Next time I visit, I might even purchase a shirt because I love your logo. Anyway, I love you and I thank you for your super cold gourmet popsicles that don't stupidly melt in like the first 10 seconds of Texas heat. Hope to see you at more events and will be back way too often at your store."
883,7/15/2014,Debbie J.,dallas-2,5,"I am officially a kool kid now!  I had the pineapple jalapeno pop.  It was chunky with pineapple and offered a big punch in your face of pepper.  I can't wait to go back and try something creamy.  It was perfect for a summer afternoon.  PERFECTION, I say!"

Updated review",Diem L.,dallas-2,4,"So this is the second time I've gone in a week.. Popsicles are SO good when the weather is so freaking hot outside. This time I got coconut while the boyfriend got caramel. We also got some pops to go too. The coconut was AMAZEBALLS. I usually prefer fruity but coconut def made my taste buds sing. I tried my boyfriends caramel and it was alright. We ordered watermelon, blood orange, strawberry cream, and buttermilk to bring home. After I woke up from a nap I just had to have another one so I ate the blood orange and it was super refreshing!! I love them allllllll (:"

886,10/7/2014,Roddy S.,dallas-2,4,Awesome on a stick!  I'm pretty sure everyone will find their flavor profile here. The Pops are refreshing and taste clean if that make sense.  Nice smiling staff and very helpful in terms of explaining the ingredients.If I could have one want answered it would be better seating to enjoy my awesome on a stick.

888,10/1/2015,Sallio H.,dallas-2,4,"Love the pineapple jalapeno popsicle. It's refreshing with a kick. The popsicle is soft enough to bite through as soon as the store employee hands it to ya, but it also doesn't drip and melt right away.  It's a bit on the pricey side for one popsicle, but it's hip, it's gourmet, the flavors are creative. I definitely wouldn't mind splurging every now and then."
889,4/19/2015,Mica M.,dallas-2,4,"Pregnant ladies: this is a blessing and a curse! Great options but, they are ever- changing. Now variety is the spice of life but cravings are the devil so beware your favorite bacon flavored pop dipped in chocolate may not be available next month. I do appreciate the small space and beautiful patio. Very yummy! I recommend the strawberry + anything! They do not disappoint."
890,6/6/2015,Hallie T.,dallas-2,4,"Love coming to this place whenever I'm in the area. I think most of their flavors are a hit or miss. Popsicles are nice soft texture, but they melt fast. My personal favorite is the vanilla cookie pop, so good! The ones I've tried and recommend are vanilla brownie, coffee/coffee brownie (actually has a good strong coffee taste), buttermilk (if you like something really creamy), strawberry cream (creamy strawberry with tint of tart), and coconut. Do not recommend the avocado, it tastes like creamy limes.  My friend got blackberry once and she said it was good but had lots of seeds in it."
891,7/13/2014,Jennifer S.,dallas-2,5,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but expectations were met and exceeded!  There was a short line during the middle of the day, but definitely worth the wait.  The place is really cute and the staff is amazing - super friendly and helpful with recommendations.  I ended up with the cherry sour cream and it was delicious!  I am clearly going to crave these tasty popsicles all summer!  A good value for $3 a pop."
892,1/20/2015,Chelsey L.,dallas-2,3,I've been dying to try this place. I went with my family over the weekend. I got the Blueberry Cream pop dipped in chocolate. I should not have added the chocolate. It was just a little too much. I couldn't even finish half of it. I tried the Sweet Tea pop and the Straberry pop and they were both good. Overall I would say the place is average. Maybe I'll give it another go around in the summer.
893,7/21/2015,Hannah L.,dallas-2,3,"Finally got to try it, but all I have to say is that it was an expensive popsicle. I got the coconut and it wasn't really anything to rave about and I don't quite understand the hype. It was good, sure, but many popsicles are. I guess ""gourmet popsicle"" would be a good way to describe it. That's all."
894,7/21/2014,Sara Beth H.,dallas-2,4,"Let me just tell you -- I'm a fan for life. I've jumped on the band wagon and I don't care who knows it! I'm a sucker for these (no pun intended -- okay, I lied. It was intended). As you'll see in most of the reviews....*popsicles -- INCREDIBLE (i'm a sucker for the creamy ones, but I'm gonna branch out next time I go).*atmosphere -- very trendy & stylish! I love their look. *menu -- very cute & clear. *parking -- SUCKS. sucks. sucks. But that's kinda the nature of the beast on Greenville Ave, I suppose. Not really their fault! *store front -- I wish it was bigger. Since it's such a hoppin' spot it's SOOO crowded. I don't think it helps that they only have 1 door to go in & out. If there were only a handful of people there it would be no problem....buuuuut when you have 20-40 people there then it becomes a problem. Honestly, I also love the background story about how it started. I love the heart behind this business. Home grown and home made with lots of family & heart. Go to their website and read about it!"
895,10/30/2015,Kiran S.,dallas-2,4,My daughter loved this place because she loves Popsicles! I thought it was overpriced for popsicles but nonetheless they were very tasty and healthy and give you a good dessert fixed without loads of calories. We had the strawberry lemonade and coconut both were yummy.
896,9/10/2014,Opal A.,dallas-2,5,"LOVE this place! The Popsicle flavors are varied, seasonal, and interesting. The pops are larger than one would expect and cost less than a double scoop at most ice cream shops. We only wish we discovered this place earlier.Here is how I would categorize the flavors I've tried to date (list to be updated as more flavors are tried):""RUN, don't walk"" FLAVORS-BLOOD ORANGE (fruity pop; tastes like blood orange syrup that's been directly frozen)-BUTTERMILK (creamy pop; tastes just like cheesecake)-STRAWBERRY (fruity pop; tastes like that sugary frozen strawberry stuff from the grocery store, but more frozen)-COCONUT (creamy pop; if you can imagine it, it tastes like coconut milk frozen, but just a tad bit sweeter)-VANILLA (creamy pop; kinda tastes like a creamier version of Blue Bell's Homemade Vanilla - awesome!)-CARAMEL (creamy pop; not overly sweet, with a subtle caramel flavor; tastes more like a milk bar with caramel hints)""Worth a Try"" FLAVORS-STRAWBERRY CREAM (creamy pop; tastes just like the strawberry pop, but with cream)-LEMON (creamy pop; tastes like lemonade mixed with bursts of creme fraiche)-HIBISCUS (fruity pop; hard to nail down the flavors here as it doesn't taste like the traditional hibiscus I've had with tea, but it's good. I would say it tastes like grape, cherry, and strawberry mixed with hibiscus)-COFFEE (creamy pop; kinda tastes like a frozen version of one of those Starbucks bottled coffee drinks)-PEACH (fruity pop; get if you really like peach flavors; tastes like frozen peach jam)""Skip 'em"" FLAVORS-AVOCADO (creamy pop; tastes like lime mixed with avocado - yuck!)-WATERMELON (fruity pop; the worst rendition of watermelon dessert that we've ever had - lacks flavor)-SWEET TEA (""fruity"" pop; just wasn't into it - tastes exactly like frozen sweet tea)If you're in the area, give this place a try, summer or winter!P.S. - If you buy 12 at a time, they'll give you a discount on the per pop price and pack them up in a freezer container that will survive a half hour in a hot summer car. :)"
897,6/13/2015,George H.,dallas-2,2,These are just ok. Lots of sugar added and makes them super sweet. I have been at least 6 times because people in dallas love this place.  Every Time I eat one I can only eat half. A better option is just north about a mile at the green grocer. They sell pop star a local dallas company. These are super refreshing and less sugar. Enjoy!
898,10/2/2014,S C.,dallas-2,5,"Love this place.Buttermilk one tastes like cheesecake and I really enjoy it even though I've never been a fan of buttermilk in my life.My other favorites include watermelon, avocado, strawberry and coconut. Just so perfect for a night cap after dinner."
899,11/15/2014,Ashley F.,dallas-2,5,Try the pumpkin Popsicle.. It's literally the best thing I've ever put in my mouth!! Haha it's delicious and they have such amazing flavors. It's like a gourmet Popsicle shop... And it couldn't be in a more perfect location. It's great to cool off in the summer but I definitely just had a popsy in thirty degree weather. Too good not to!

Updated review",Jackie K.,dallas-2,5,I've been back five times and tried a new flavor each time--I haven't found a flavor I didn't like yet!
901,10/18/2014,kimberly n.,dallas-2,3,"The line was long but def moved fast. We pick the cranberry orange popsicle and they cherry sour cream. Cherry sour cream wasn't actually sour is very creamy. Cranberry orange was bitter and we threw it away after 2 bites. He went back inside and was going to buy another one but they actually gave us another one on the house! TI'll have to try mango (they didn't have it today) coffee, sweet tea and chocolate next time! The poached pear had a cinnamon taste as if it's been poached for hours. I tasted real pears in it. It was just ok"
902,5/31/2014,Eva F.,dallas-2,5,"Icy deliciousness. Such friendly service, and I just love the idea of a popsicle store.Cucumber/Lime: refreshing, super yummy, I love the unique flavour combo.Buttermilk: YUM! Tastes like cheesecake, I loved that it was subtly sweet.Banana: Another subtly sweet one, obviously made with delicious real fruit and not just flavouring.Chili chocolate: Another YUM! I loved the rich chocolate with the kick of chili. The end is dipped in a kind of spiced cinnamon mix, which complemented the flavours so well.This is definitely a summer staple!"
903,10/5/2015,Amanda T.,dallas-2,3,"I know this place is popular right now, but I really don't see what the big deal is. It's good but it's just a bunch of over priced fancy popsicles. Nothing special. I'd rather have Bahama Bucks."
904,10/29/2014,Grace C.,dallas-2,5,"Fun place! Sometimes you just have to continue to try pop by pop to find your favorites.  That's all part of the fun!  I don't go too often, but I like this as my $3 morehealthythanmyotheroptions, dessert on special nights. I was concerned for what they would do during the winter, but thankfully Dallas keeps winter shorts and they change the menu seasonally (even though we have only had two seasons with them so far).  Also, I have heard that the owners are Christian, which is a plus for me! Love to support a business like this."
905,10/14/2015,Rahul B.,dallas-2,5,Lived up to the hype! Got the carrot cake flavor and it blew the taste buds right out of my mouth. Isn't overpriced at $3. As Arnie once said - Ill be back!
906,6/16/2015,Liqiu I.,dallas-2,5,Oh my goodness it is the best place. They have the best Popsicles ever. I recommend the coffee brownie cookie Pop or the blood orange Pop. They have so many to choose from.
907,6/1/2014,Shawna B.,dallas-2,5,Omg first time here & this coffee popsicle is off the chain!! GO HERE! This place is poppin!
908,8/3/2014,Kimberly H.,dallas-2,4,"So delicious and the long lines move quickly. I wish every popsicle didn't have so much added sugar, but alas, it was worth the extra calories. I had the coffee flavor: very creamy and smooth! I only purchased one, as we were just galavanting down Greenville but I'd definitely buy the 4 for $10 option otherwise. Can't wait to try some of their more fruity flavors!"
909,8/27/2014,Shams B.,dallas-2,5,"A cold popsicle on a hot day is heaven, especially when you have as many delicious flavors as this place has. Other than saying this place is fantastic, there's really not much more to say. I've had Watermelon, Blood Orange and Strawberry and each of them deserve a round of applause. Simplicity done right is the way to go and this place has quality over quantity by the truck load."
910,9/16/2015,Dalton D.,dallas-2,5,"Definitely a must if you are in the Dallas/Greenville area! The atmosphere is great. Perfect date night desert spot. The popsicles are made at the location, and are definitely some of the best I have ever had. My personal favorite was the Mexican Chocolate, but I can not wait to go back and try the Pumpkin!"
911,4/21/2015,Dive B.,dallas-2,3,Jalapeno pineapple reminded me of the sauce you'd find on chinese food.  I didn't finish it as I couldn't get the thought of that flavor out of my head.  The peanut butter cup was not really all that great either.  Pretty unique but not really for me.
912,5/15/2015,Jennie L.,dallas-2,5,"Even on a gloomy day, it's hard to say no to Popsicles! Staff was super friendly as well!"
913,6/3/2014,Kim P.,dallas-2,4,"The one lady working at the store on a Sunday afternoon didn't come off as particularly friendly.I ordered an avocado. Bit into it and got more of a limey taste. It wasn't bad, it just definitely did not taste like avocado. So I thought maybe if I ate a little bit more, maybe the avocado flavor was just too subtle. I ate about 1/4 of the bar and decided I had had enough of the lime. Perhaps they had put a cucumber-lime in the avocado bucket by mistake? Although a fellow Yelper tipped that the avocado tasted like a key lime pie. So maybe change the name to reflect that? The sign on the counter said if I wasn't happy, I could switch it out for another flavor. I got back into line, which took a little bit because there were two big orders and only one employee. I asked if I could switch it out for peanut butter. She looked at my popsicle and gave me an incredulous look. And I explained that it didn't taste like avocado, it tasted like lime. Way too much like lime the more I ate it. And she said ""oh, but you've eaten so much of it."" But went ahead and gave me the peanut butter. Umm, I'm not lying to you. If I were happy with the popsicle, I would have eaten it all. But I wasn't happy because it did not taste like avocado. Is there a maximum amount of ice cream you're allowed to eat posted somewhere? Was she going to resell my unwanted pop? I did not appreciate the judgement, especially when there's a sign posted about customer satisfaction right on the counter. I'm still giving it 4 stars because my friends liked theirs and the peanut butter which tasted like peanut butter was wonderful. Thanks."
914,9/24/2015,Jacob J.,dallas-2,5,"Never thought a Popsicle could be so damn good. Great on a hot summer day. The cookie pops were my favorite but the fruit ones hit the spot as well, definitely recommend."
915,7/14/2014,Adrien G.,dallas-2,5,Friendly and happy staff and the best freaking Popsicle I've ever had. I feel like Popsicle doesn't really do it justice... I got an avocado pop. Sweet and creamy and the best thing ever.
916,2/7/2015,None N.,dallas-2,4,"A year long, gourmet popsicle shop may be crazy or plain genius, but either way, it seems to be working. The pops are a clear up grade from the boxed freezer version- I've never seen an avocado or hibiscus flavored popsicle at the grocery store. And, if you're already having a meal in the area, it's an easy walk over for a fun post dinner treat. But, while it's cheaper than a restaurant dessert, it's still considerably more expensive that the store bought version. Seating is limited, so during hot months, when the popularity peaks, you may need to enjoy your pop on the side-walk outside."
917,7/30/2014,Paul D.,dallas-2,5,"Man, I'm going to miss this place now that I'm back in Southern California!I had the pleasure of discovering Steel City Pops while perusing the Farmer's Market in Dallas.  Their cart had a small assortment of flavors, but all that mattered was that they had a coffee pop and that it was ridiculously humid outside.  Perhaps it was the heat that was getting to me, but I felt like I was being lifted to heaven with just that first taste.  Needless to say, that sucker was finished before the heat could melt it down to the creamy coffee that it once was.  What I loved most were the coffee grinds in the popsicle itself.Fastforward a couple days to my last day in Dallas.  Lo and behold I ended up in the area where this location is!  There wasn't a line when I stumbled upon it while looking for a restaurant, but that changed as soon as my meal was finished as the line was out the door!  Thankfully the line moved quickly enough for me and my friend to squeeze in to the building.  The choice of flavors was far more expansive than what was available at the cart, and I was quite overwhelmed by all of the delicious-sounding choices.  After debating between pineapple jalapeno and coconut, I decided to play it safe with the coconut (I'll come back for you, pineapple jalapeno!).The coconut popsicle was absolutely amazing.  There's shreds of toasted coconut in the popsicle itself that really help to enhance the flavor.  Definitely wishing I had one right now...I did get to try a bit of my friend's avocado popsicle.  I'm personally not a fan of avocado ice cream or smoothies, but the flavor on this one was bearable thanks to the lime.  She, however, is a huge fan of avocado treats, so the lime flavor in the popsicle was too much for her as it distracted from the avocado flavor.  I guess it depends on what type of avocado treats you normally consume.At $3.00/pop, with various discounts for buying in larger quantities, I'd say it's a fair price to pay for such a quality treat."
918,7/30/2015,Maymuna M.,dallas-2,5,It does not have to be hot out for you to enjoy a steel city pop! The selection of flavors are endless. It is a perfect location
919,7/9/2014,Louis M.,dallas-2,5,"I would like to retract my last review.  The manager, Joey after hearing about what had occurred reference my inability to order the quinoa burger on the rooftop, graciously apologized.  He mentioned I should have been able to order my selection from the main menu instead of ordering take out and then bringing it upstairs.  He graciously apologized about the miscommunication with his staff.  He mentioned HG prides itself on customer service.  Joey the manger was very understanding of the inconvenience and rectified the issue in addition to taking care of dessert for everyone in my group. I really appreciate the forward thinking of this restaurant .  They have vegan options use humanly raised meat products and use coconut oil for frying.  They truly are on the leading edge for healthy options in Dallas.  Thank you Joey and the rest of your staff for making this an AwEsOmE experience.  Thanks to our waitress Connie for addressing this issue."
920,7/2/2015,Jason R.,dallas-2,5,"Haters gonna hate. This place is delicious and the 5 star reviews are on point. Only thing that hasn't been said is that they sell 4 packs for $16. Get a couple cookie pops in there, and you can save a buck. You also get a free ice pack to ice a black eye after standing up for the deliciousness that is SCP. Don't sleep on the buttermilk. Tastes like cream cheese heaven. The temperature of the creamier pops is perfect - not too cold that it hurts your teeth. It falls apart in your mouth. So good."
921,7/20/2014,Mindy T.,dallas-2,5,"My new favorite ice-cream place. I got a chocolate creamy, it's so delicious. I will try the avocado next time. Great place!!"
922,9/30/2015,Rori M.,dallas-2,5,They are always nice and attentive. The pops are always yummy and refreshing. They are doing it right!!!
923,8/8/2014,Meagan F.,dallas-2,5,"I love Steel City Pops and recommend it to just about anyone that mentions going to Dallas!The flavors are true to what they say they are. Creamy flavors are rich and delicious and fruity flavors are refreshing and tasty. There will probably be a line out the door, but don't be discouraged! It moves quickly :)Parking is rough at times, but worth the time and walk. My faves are coconut, vanilla bean and coffee, in that order. But I've tasted many others and have not been disappointed... besides the avocado. It was good, however a little too sour for my liking."
924,6/8/2015,Russ W.,dallas-2,4,"These are not inexpensive, so don't come here if you don't have a couple of bucks to indulge yourself. That said, you're gonna love this place, the people and not least, the pops. Order what sounds appealing to you and you will not be disappointed."
925,7/15/2015,Hilary P.,dallas-2,5,"Walked in on a whim, got an avocado pop. I will never buy Popsicles from the grocery store ever again."
926,7/14/2015,Amanda Z.,dallas-2,4,"I love the concept of a Popsicle shop, which is absolutely perfect on a hot summer day exploring Dallas. There is a line, but you'll be at the register before you know it because all they have to do is hand out Popsicles. Popsicle flavors are unique and tasty- especially enjoyed the avocado, but mint orange green tea was also very refreshing! Great place to cool off and hang out with friends! Will be coming back to try out more flavors."
927,6/21/2015,Phillip T.,dallas-2,4,"Love it! I ordered the creamy ice cream with the frozen brownie inside.  Aargh it was so good.  I only wish it was closer because I would've gone back much more often.  Their other popsicles were good too, the Blood Orange flavor was really good as well."
928,8/26/2014,Samantha C.,dallas-2,5,"LOVE THIS PLACE! I do wish i lived in the area, we were on vacation visiting family and happened to walk past and decided to stop in and we were all glad we did! they have 2 sides one with dairy and more if an ice cream texture and then a more traditional side. we all enjoyed the fruity ones the blueberry is AMAZING. if you are in the area i think you have to swing by, you wont be disapointed."
929,7/3/2015,Ly A.,dallas-2,5,"Delicious!! I'm obsessed with the brownie coffee pop (even if it's $4.50). It's the best after dinner dessert. The brownie still stays chewy and the coffee ice cream around it is perfectly creamy and soft.PS. don't get the avocado...there was too much lime flavor in it. Tasted like I was getting guac on a stick. Good thing is if you don't like your pop, let them know and you can get a different flavor!"
930,5/26/2014,Vicki N.,dallas-2,5,Read an article about this place and had to try it the next day with the bf. I got the pineapple jalapeño and the bf got peanut butter. Super yummy flavors. Pineapple was refreshing while the jalapeño gave just enough heat to finish. The peanut butter was so creamy but not overly rich in flavor or sweetness. We'll definitely be back to try all the flavors. Each popsicle is $3 or you can buy a  packaged cooler bag of 4 for $10. They also give you a new popsicle if you don't like flavor you chose. Thanks SCP for choosing Dallas as a city to expand the franchise.
931,7/16/2015,Mabel F.,dallas-2,4,"Caramel, strawberry lemonade, brownie  and cookie dough were all good.  The strawberry lemonade was our fave.  We were at the Firewheel location."
932,3/21/2016,Rehma W.,dallas-2,5,My friend and I visited last week and we are beyond obsessed! We purchased blackberry and raspberry and lemon. Perfect for a hot summer day. Great prices! Will visit again very soon.
933,5/30/2015,Samantha T.,dallas-2,5,"Ugh I can't love this place enough. I do the drive from Frisco and take a bag home when I do, so I can enjoy SCP through the week :) the staff is awesome, I love how modern the place is and it really is all about simple customer service and ice cream!"
934,5/8/2015,Reena P.,dallas-2,4,"Steel City Pops was really great! I went right around closing time so that's probably why the service was so rushed but the pops were really refreshing.  I have yet to try their creamy pops but I have tried the cucumber mint and strawberry lemonade.  It tasted very fresh and I took 2 to go and the lady was nice enough to give me an ice pack to take them in.  I was kind of hoping that it would have fresh fruit pieces in it but, maybe their newer flavors will!"
935,8/20/2015,Vendredi C.,dallas-2,4,"Steel City Pops has incredibly creative and full flavors. I just recently picked up a bunch to give to one of my best friends for her birthday. The creamy ones are great when you are looking for something rich, and the juice ones are good when you want something refreshing. Also, this whole section of Greenville is fun and worth visiting."
936,4/11/2015,Richel R.,dallas-2,5,"I wish I took a photo of my creamy blueberry pop, but it was gone before I remembered to preserve with a kodak. I was visiting around March in the craziness of St. Patty's day celebrations on Greenville Avenue. My first time in Dallas and I'm really loving the various districts and how pedestrian friendly this side of town is. I would definitely come back here and try one of their fruity flavors...maybe on one of those hot summer days I keep hearing everyone talk about."
937,8/12/2015,Anne H.,dallas-2,1,I got the Lime and it was worse than a store bought pop. I also got a chocolate peanut butter after to try to give them another chance...still kinda just tasted icier and more bland than a fudge pop
938,7/25/2014,J M.,dallas-2,5,"I was skeptical because I really didn't think there could be anything that special about a popsicle, but WOW did this place prove me wrong. Without question, the best popsicle I've had in my life. By a long shot. I got the strawberry cream one, and highly recommend it. My friends got lemon and blackberry and those were pretty excellent as well."
939,2/4/2016,Jamie C.,dallas-2,4,It's a cool place to stop by on hot summer days. The worker helped me and my friend choose our flavors and they tasted gooooood. They have many different flavors available and has cool interior. They also have a little porch outside where you can sit and eat your popsicles. I can't wait to visit again when the weather warms up!
940,6/24/2015,Sherri G.,dallas-2,4,"Really great (though, it's still just popsicles). I had the chocolate peanut butter and was not disappointed. It's also a good spot to sit outside and people watch!"
941,6/23/2015,Shieds K.,dallas-2,2,"Not sure what the hype is... $3 for a Popsicle that tasted like water, SUGAR and artificial flavoring (fruit)... Like frozen Sugar Water...Not impressed"
942,5/20/2015,Diana V.,dallas-2,5,"I got the vanilla brownie, best choice I made! So delicious!! If I didn't live so far from it I would be a frequent customer"
943,3/14/2015,Antony M.,dallas-2,4,A very nice dessert place. They have a wonderful selection of ice cream pops. They also have a few low sugar options that are made with cane sugar so it is better for diabetics.
944,2/18/2016,Melissa C.,dallas-2,5,"My husband and I went twice one day because we just had to get more! The flavors are delicious, savory, and have a lot of flavor. Definitely worth it!"
945,7/1/2015,Lindsey R.,dallas-2,5,Best popsicles in Dallas. Avocado popsicle might be the best summer treat ive had!
946,7/11/2015,MJ C.,dallas-2,5,"We got the Pineapple Jalapeno and Strawberry Lemonade.  I didn't like the Pineapple Jalapeno - a little too spicy for me.  But, it was cool because they let me switch it out to something else.  I got to try the Pina Colada and that was so much better.  At $3 each, I'm glad they let you switch it out if you don't like it.  I'll definitely be back.  There are lots of flavors that I still want to try."
947,6/23/2015,Kim M.,dallas-2,5,"I had been dying to try out Steel City Pops after hearing all the rave reviews this place has been getting. My husband and I were in the neighborhood this past weekend, so I just HAD to stop by before leaving. This place is AMAZING! I admit, I was a bit disappointed when I saw the huge crowd/line, but as the other reviews said, it goes by fairly fast. My husband had the Vanilla Brownie and I had the Avocado flavor. And let me tell you, they were delicious! These popsicles definitely lived up to the hype and I was extremely happy with the whole experience. The only small downside is that it was pretty pricey for a popsicle ($3-4). Don't let that scare you though. Try it at least once--you won't regret it!"
948,9/10/2015,Mark W.,dallas-2,5,This place should be in every city. It's great to have another option besides fro-yo and ice cream for desserts. You can get fresh fruit Popsicles or creamy ones depending on what you're in the mood for. Go if you have the chance. You won't be disappointed and it will probably take you no time to earn a free pop through their punch card program.
949,4/8/2015,Ashley T.,dallas-2,5,"This place is awesome!  I chose hibiscus, blood orange, peanut butter, and chocolate. The gentlemen who assisted me was kind and courteous to my questions. As soon as I got home, I tried the hibiscus and oh my god, it's the best popsicle I've ever had. The flavor was all there, it was just sweet enough and the hibiscus flavor was perfect. I expect the same from the rest of the flavors I chose and I will definitely be coming back again."
950,5/1/2015,Food-Travel-Adventure A.,dallas-2,4,"Loved it!  This is a small place so there was a line depending on which time of the day you go.  My favorite favor was the coconut.  The first time I ordered something different and didn't like it as much as the coconut, but it was good tho.  The second times we ordered a box which cost about $42 (30 of different kinds - i think ).  A friend of mine told me a regular box cost around $30, bc I have chocolate chip cookies so it cost extra.  Each box came with small bags of ice to keep it cold.  Overall this place have good ice cream and good services, but it a little pricy for an ice cream."
951,6/20/2015,Kevin N.,dallas-2,4,"The Coffee Brownie was AMAZING! Parking is little annoying, but the popsicle was very much worth it. I noticed the cookie popsicles melt faster so lick fast!"
952,11/14/2014,Jill L.,dallas-2,4,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed these guys before. We've tried a number of the fruit and creamy pops here and the flavors are always intense. My fave remains the blood orange. One pop is big enough for most adults to share, though the kiddos will likely want their own. We've taken visitors from out of town here, young and old, and it is always, always a hit. Great vibe."
953,5/18/2015,Amanda H.,dallas-2,5,"Must try! This place was amazing. Seriously, what an awesome idea! My friends and I tried the coconut, peanut butter and chocolate, coffee, and vanilla chocolate chip. They were all so good!! They have a small area out front to sit and eat, but Popsicles are totally portable. They offer insulated bags to take to-go orders. Pricing was reasonable for an artisan style cool treat! I'm guessing their menu changes flavors, but I'm not positive. Highly recommend it!"
954,8/7/2014,Paige G.,dallas-2,5,"Just moved to the area and love steel city pops! Can be a long line, but it's worth it."
955,4/11/2015,Mellisa G.,dallas-2,5,Very yummy and unique! Love the atmosphere! So many choices...started with chocolate peanut butter
956,12/11/2014,Jason B.,dallas-2,3,"i dont get it, the crazy fandom. its freakin popsicle on a stick that charges too much?? didn't change my life. trust me i spend STUPID amounts of money on food but this place didnt' do it, maybe if i try some of the original flavors??"
957,2/11/2015,Susan C.,dallas-2,5,"We just moved close by, and we were excited to have a cute place to take our 3 year old daughter as a treat.  They are delicious and worth the price!  I love that they don't melt quickly at all.  My favorite is now cucumber lime...so delicious and refreshing without being too sweet!The reason I am writing this review is because of our visit last night.  My daughter was so excited to get her ""pink popsicle"" that the moment we put it into her hands, she dropped it on the floor.  My boyfriend and I just gave each other a look, and before we had time to react, the employee offered us another one.  This is great customer service!  Maybe this wouldn't happen if an adult did the same, but I love how he kept us happy, even when it was our fault.So thank you, Steel City Pops!  We will continue to come weekly!"
958,3/27/2015,Cynthia S.,dallas-2,5,"Amazing popsicles! It is the perfect place to walk to after having dinner at the many other delicious restaurants off Greenville. The fruit flavored pops are delicious and great if you're watching your calorie intake, and the brownie pops are just the right amount of sweet. I love this place!"
959,8/27/2014,Megan B.,dallas-2,4,"This spot helps make summertime in Texas just a wee bit more tolerable. Great atmosphere and great flavor selections (the chocolate pop is divine!). While $3/popsicle seems a bit absurd, it's a fun treat you don't feel guilty about since they're using natural ingredients."
960,8/4/2014,Tori W.,dallas-2,4,"Very tasty, uniquely flavored popsicles... but I'm assuming the overpriced popsicle fad will pass eventually."
961,5/25/2015,Athena H.,dallas-2,5,"The best. popsicles, ever. I get so much leverage with my children by dangling this place like a carrot if they clean their room, go to bed on-time, etc... My son is partial to the banana and my daughter loves the chocolate. I love the passion fruit. We've tried most of the flavors and they are all really great."
962,1/29/2015,Aimee F.,dallas-2,5,"Ready for the weather to get warmm so we can return!  Wish they had a drive thru, we would go more often if parking wasn't sometimes difficult.  Sour cream cherry is the best!  The citrus ones can be a bit tart/too authentic to eat in large quantities, but the sour cream cherry goes down way too easily!"
963,4/6/2015,Guillermo V.,dallas-2,5,The best pops! My favorites are Hibiscus from the water-based side and Coffee from the creamy side. I love eating these pops out on the porch after I buy them.
964,1/22/2015,Fred W.,dallas-2,4,"Ok I know how it sounds, ""ice pops?"" whats the big deal? But man I have got to hand it to them, they are REALLY GOOD! As an adult I never thought I would get excited over ice pops lol, but if i wasn't watching my diet I could go here everday. The unique flavor combos *and the classic* are just amazing.  Give this place a try its like being a kid again!"
965,5/15/2014,Bryn B.,dallas-2,5,"Steel City Pops, instantly brought me back to my childhood summer memories as I inhaled my chocolate cream popsicle. This might be the first popsicle place in Dallas and I like the concept. These gourmet popsicles are about  $2.50 a pop and come in unique flavors such as Basil Blueberry, Pineapple Jalepeno, Orange Mint Green Tea, Cucumber Lime, Peanut Butter cream and Coconut cream, just to name a few of their large variety.  All of their pops are organic with no artificial flavoring, no refined sugars, vegan, gluten-free and under 200 calories! Conveniently located next to the health conscious HG Supply Co and across from Trader Joe's. Since it's that time of year, when people are secretly judging you at the pool in a bathing suit; when I'm craving something sweet and frozen this summer, I might have to drive to this place instead of driving to find the nearest blue bell ice cream."
966,3/14/2015,Angela P.,dallas-2,5,The cream pops (coffee) had my mouth quenching for more. I got a frequent shopper card. This place is so worth going back to! I will be visiting on a regular. The service was nice and the location is friendly.
967,8/11/2014,Hilary T.,dallas-2,5,Such an innovative take on such a classic summertime favorite! This place is awesome with both classic and unique flavored Popsicles. I've had a Pineapple Jalapeno pop and Peach pop. The PJ doesn't taste as crazy as it sounds and it has quite a kick to it. The Peach tastes just like the fruit and you can even see some of the pulp as you're eating it! I love the freshness that this place offers and would come here everyday if I could!
968,11/18/2014,Renee C.,dallas-2,5,I love the pops here! They make their own unique flavors.  I personal favorite was basil blueberry but they don't make them anymore :( . My second to recommend is coffee! I really hope they change their avocado flavor because it is way too sour and needs a spice too it.  If you don't like a flavor they are really nice about letting you pick out another one.
969,7/12/2014,Drew T.,dallas-2,5,"Don't let the line that wraps around the building deter you, the line moves like lightning - 5 min tops. The Cherry sour cream is life changing!!! Repeat customer, Steel City Pops does ice cream right! They also sell in bulk in 4 and 10 and I'm sure larger increments. Parking is a nightmare but Steel City Pops makes it all worth it!"
970,12/19/2015,Rebecca N.,dallas-2,5,"I love their rotating seasonal menus, and their cream-based popsicles are the best. Their sweet potato pecan popsicle sounds so strange, but is actually one of my favorites. You won't ever be disappointed by the coffee or chocolate chili pops. Can't wait till the Casa Linda location opens!"
971,1/11/2015,Ariel M.,dallas-2,5,"Let's start with the basics, this place sells popsicle for about $3 each, I think that you get a discount if you purchase 4 or more. The popsicles come in a large variety of flavors that change seasonally, the flavors are divided into two categories fruit flavors and cream. I had the Bourbon, maple and bacon popsicle, it was one of the seasonal specialties, and before you are sceptical, it was quite delicious. Also just fyi you have the option of having your popsicle dipped in chocolate. Yummy!"
972,1/4/2015,Lisa B.,dallas-2,5,"Wasn't so crazy about coming here in the middle of December, but it is definitely worth it.My teeth are sensitive and usually I can't bite into cold items without my teeth hurting. However, I easily bit into these creamsicles with enjoyment. Been here with two different groups, and no one was disappointed. The texture is super smooth, and the flavors are exciting. I've tried the banana, coffee, eggnog, and blueberry cream. Personal favorite is coffee. Service is great. I've been to both the Dallas and Fort Worth location, and both cashiers are always smiling. One of my cousins tried a flavor and didn't like it, and was offered another creamsicle free of charge."
973,8/13/2014,Katie T.,dallas-2,4,Yummy popsicles perfect for Texas heat!  I just wish they had some mixed flavors... That way you can have more flavors when you are indecisive like me. It's a great place to stop when you're hanging out on Greenville ave!
974,9/10/2015,Sarah Y.,dallas-2,5,I grew up next to a palateria in Mexico and maaann this place was so reminiscent! The lime Popsicle was so good that I ended up buying a box and keep these in the house regularly. This place is definitely worth the hype!
975,5/25/2014,Preston T.,dallas-2,3,"My favorite were the vanilla and cucumber/lime. The price is very fair, and the best part is that you can trade in a pop if you don't like it. I got the pineapple/jalapeno and I hated it (tasted like sweet and sour sauce you get with chinese food). The employee did not have any reservations in getting me another one."
976,10/22/2014,D. R.,dallas-2,4,"I've had the Pumpkin, Chocolate, Coconut, Watermelon and Coffee....My fav is the COFFEE!! Wish they had samples....that would be Fantastic!"
977,1/11/2015,Shahbaaz A.,dallas-2,5,"Popsicle places in New York can be around $9 a popsicle! Here it's really cheap. The flavors are really good, so much variety and all very high quality tasting. They even have the calories listed by each popsicle flavor on the menu. They have cream based and fruit based. The hibiscus is really good and refreshing. Very good customer service also. If you don't like a popsicle you can trade it out for another one."
978,10/19/2014,Marsha E.,dallas-2,5,There are just some guilty pleasures that aren't guilty.  SCP is one of those. We love this place but HATE the parking issue.  Fall favorites are cranberry orange and butter pecan. .awww but I miss the summer days and blood orange.
979,9/21/2014,Lisa P.,dallas-2,4,"These Popsicles are yumm.  So far, I've been able to try the coconut, watermelon, and peanut butter and would recommend all three. Their popsicles are dense and creamy and their flavors are strong.  The popsicles are a bit heavy on the sweetness, imo, but that's a matter of personal preference.  I still highly enjoyed them and one stick got me feeling full...I know it's really hard to justify spending too much money on a popsicle.  For $3, I would say it's worth it... but barely. I think I'll save this place for days when I feel like treating myself."
980,11/29/2014,S A.,dallas-2,5,Amazing! First time there had to have the Pumpkin Dipped in Dark Chocolate. DELICIOUSNESS!
981,10/7/2014,Henry R.,dallas-2,5,"Loved the popsicles, amazingly stupidly good! I have only  tried the pomegranate and the peach and they were both so good! Still need to try the legendary avocado and lime popsicle."
982,10/6/2014,Kiti A.,dallas-2,5,"S.C.P totally deserves the full five star!!!!! We've had strawberries&cream, coconut, melon, and this water based raspberry one (forgot name). Absolutely delicious!!!!! The coconut pop melts in your mouth! They're fresh and all natural. No crazy sweeteners or ingredients. That's one of the best parts. They taste REAL. The melon pop tastes exactly like my mom's homemade melon juice (agua de melon). Next up: avocado!"
983,3/17/2015,Patricia T.,dallas-2,5,"As a certified ice-cream/pop fanatic... SCP is my all-time favorite popsicle joint ever. I repeat, EVER. I mean, I drive 30+mins just to come to this joint! Everything about this place is wonderful. Trendy environment, great staff that is patient and helps you choose a popsicle flavor, and their seasonal rotating pops. They have a great variety from fruity to creamy and now, to cookie pops! I'm in deep unconditional love with their hibiscus, cucumber lime, and jalapeno pineapple pops. You have not learned the secret to life until you've tried one of these flavors. All my friends that I brought said, ""this was def. worth the ride."" And not only that- my boyfriend brought me a thermal bag once and the icecream was still fresh and frozen and just as amazing!"
984,9/29/2014,Christina K.,dallas-2,4,$3 a popsicle is pretty pricey...but I keep going back. Bring some friends and share the 4 or 12 pack - bulk discount!! Love the Blood Orange and Sweet Tea. It's a pretty nice treat when it's burning hot outside here in Texas.
985,10/22/2015,Adriana C.,dallas-2,4,I love anything trendy and this little shop is just that. A casual and easy place to stop by and contemplate which crazy flavor to choose from quite eclectic menu.
986,5/22/2014,Sydney S.,dallas-2,5,Popsicles are going to be the next big thing! I went here for the first time today and had the watermelon popsicle (so yummy tasted a little like frozen watermelon) and my sister had the avocado which was actually awesome. Really cute little store with chalk board menu and nice cool outdoor patio. Steel City Pops is going to make popsicles the next big thing in dallas!
987,10/26/2014,Shawn H.,dallas-2,5,"Best and most fun experience ever. This place is addicting. Love the butter pecan. Will return for sure, nightly."
988,9/25/2014,C B.,dallas-2,5,"Yum!!! Loved loved loved the avocado popsicle! As a matter of fact, my kids even tried to ditch theirs because they liked mine so much. (though theirs were great too...blood orange...)"
989,8/23/2014,Mares V.,dallas-2,5,Love this popsicle place! One reason I did not want to leave Dallas for the suburbs :(  The pineapple jalapeno is the only flavor I have not care for so far and would not recommend it. However everything else is top notch quality!
990,7/11/2014,Janet J.,dallas-2,4,"Good Pop step aside a new fresh ingredient Popsicle is in town. Yes! Delicious! Yes there was a line at 2pm on  Friday, but it wasn't long and it went quickly. I got a 4 pack that included: cantaloupe, cucumber lime, chocolate and sweet tea. So far we've had cantaloupe which was refreshing and had fruit pieces in each bite. It did start to be a bit overwhelming as I was finishing it. You can tell these are NOT watered down. The full flavor lasts until the end. Chocolate was creamy and chocolate-y. Great, rich chocolate flavor. Cucumber lime was SO good and refreshing! Tasted like a Braums Limeaid! Sweet Tea was also the business. Great place!"
991,7/10/2014,Clayton G.,dallas-2,3,"$3 for a Popsicle is steep but it is a damn good Popsicle!  Great selection.  Fairly small place, so you most likely will need to eat it outside.  In the current weather, you will be luck to get 1/2 way done before the drips start occurring.   I would go back with my kids for a treat.  Again, good, but not great.  If you are in the area, I say stop by, but I would not make a special trip just for a popsicle."
992,7/30/2014,Camille R.,dallas-2,5,Gluten-free review: All pops are gluten-free. I had the chocolate pop...it was AMAZING! perfect creamy consistency and perfect chocolate flavor!!!!
993,10/18/2015,Denea B.,dallas-2,5,Fantastic find!!! My husband is in love with the cheesecake pop & I had the chocolate pop. They were both so good that we bought 12 more in a to-go cooler. Well worth the trip & so glad we stumbled upon it!
994,10/5/2015,Ryan B.,dallas-2,4,Who knew popsicles could be so good.  Used them for a work function recently and will do so again.  PB and chocolate and strawberry were the favs.
995,9/8/2014,Santino D.,dallas-2,5,Love this place. I work next door at HG SPLY CO so I'm there a lot. Amazing creations for Popsicles. And I don't even like Popsicles.
996,10/20/2014,Cassie E.,dallas-2,5,SCP always has fun seasonal flavors. I haven't had one I didn't like!
997,7/15/2014,Hannah C.,dallas-2,5,"I have only tried four kinds of pops from Steel City, but I am already a huge fan.  I've been raving about these things to anyone who will listen.  I have had the vanilla, avocado, bluberry basil, and blood orange.  The fruity ones are bright and refreshing, while the creamy ones are smooth and indulgent.  I can't wait to try more flavors!"
998,7/14/2015,Diana G.,dallas-2,5,"Ahhhhhhhmazing. Their Cookie pops were the bomb dot com. A chocolate chip cookie center with a vanilla pop outer shell. Heaven on a stick. Next time me and J visit Dallas again, we are stopping here again to try the other favors."
999,8/3/2014,Polly S.,dallas-2,5,"Can (currently) vouch for the caramel, coconut, cucumber lime, cherry sour cream, strawberry balsamic, watermelon, peanut butter, sweet cream and blueberry basil.  They do not disappoint."
1000,7/9/2014,Francesca B.,dallas-2,5,"Steel City Pops is a perfect antidote to a hot Texas day! The staff is super friendly , the place is clean and cool and the pops are divine .  This is a must visit spot."
1001,5/31/2014,Paige N.,dallas-2,5,Delicious creamy goodness! The avocado Popsicle was so refreshing. The staff is very friendly and service was quick! Definitely recommend it.
1002,9/18/2014,JW M.,dallas-2,5,Always a great night on Lower Greenville when you finish it off with a Steel City Pop. Gotta go with the creamy choices over fruity. Caramel & Coconut won't disappoint!
1003,9/16/2015,Matthew L.,dallas-2,2,I had heard good things about this place but didn't experience them first-hand last night...maybe I caught them on a bad day??
1004,7/25/2014,Carrie H.,dallas-2,5,Don't let the line scare you if it's long!  We tried vanilla bean and pineapple jalapeño. Buttermilk is very popular. I hear chocolate chili sells out a lot. It was the night we went. Going to ft worth location tonight.
1005,8/14/2014,Charlie D.,dallas-2,3,"It was a solid Popsicle but I personally didn't think it was anything special, but I will say that I wasn't toooo adventurous"
1006,8/8/2014,steve m.,dallas-2,5,Never thought I would get excited about a popsicle..... until now.  These are amazing.  You gotta try it out!  they are super fresh and the flavors are vibrant and creative.  Its great for people of all ages
1007,6/13/2014,Yaz D.,dallas-2,3,"I wasn't really impressed. First, parking is a nightmare on Greenville, unless you wanna pay $5 for valet to buy a $3 pop. 2nd, the place was warm when I walked in, not what you'd expect from a frozen treats shop. I got the caramel pop. The taste was great and creamy, but not unique. Finally, the pop started melting as soon as I removed the wrapper. It was melting so fast I just sat down on the bench outside and let it run down my hand and drip on the sidewalk. I noticed other people were having the same problem. The non-creamy flavors didn't seem to melt the same way. Maybe it just wasn't my day (not gonna make a special trip back to try again)."
1008,8/6/2014,Maddison R.,dallas-2,2,"The pops are good and fun, but this location needs to work on their customer service quite a bit.. I know they're probably just high schoolers, I know they're usually really busy, but I don't think the girl that just helped my husband and I spoke a single word to us. She just waited for us to pick out our pops, pay, and leave. It would be a way more enjoyable experience and fun atmosphere if it looked like the employees were happy."
1009,7/31/2015,Natalie R.,dallas-2,5,"My coworkers and I are loyal Steep City Poppers! We frequent the cart in Klyde Warren. Their customer service is top notch!! We love the avocado, buttermilk, coffee, coconut, strawberry lemonade, blackberry...the list goes on!"
1010,6/29/2015,Ryan S.,dallas-2,5,"After an unfortunate experience across the street at Carnival Barkers, I was not about to have my nice Sunday night out for ice cream to be limited to that. So we walked to Steel City Pops and my Sunday night was instantly revived. They have an array of flavors I am interested in trying in the near future. The vanilla chocolate chip was great! It has a baked chocolate chip cookie froze right into the pop. The strawberry lemonade pop was extremely refreshing, even has the strawberry seeds to add a little extra texture. The front waiting/ordering area is a bit small and chaotic upon entering but it goes quick. Very transactional experience, but it's done with a smile which leaves a smile on your face."
1011,6/23/2014,Ha N.,dallas-2,5,"I had the Blueberry Basil. It was very unique and delicious! They have dozens of flavors, going to take me months to try them all."
1012,5/26/2014,Madelyn A.,dallas-2,5,"Delicious popsicles! I had blood orange and my friend had the chili chocolate. The blood orange was like eating the fruit itself, only frozen. Chili chocolate was sweet with just the right amount of spice. Some of the best popsicles I've had in a while."
1013,7/11/2014,Therese L.,dallas-2,5,SIMPLY THE BEST! I have never tasted anything so wonderful in my life. I am completely addicted to these pops! Packed with flavor. I can't imagine anything better for these hot summer days. =)
1014,1/22/2015,Bryan S.,dallas-2,3,"I've been spoiled with the Orange creamsicles and Big red bomb pops from the ice cream trucks so when it comes to homemade pops its not that I don't like them but I'm just used to the good old days!! Any how's, moving along with the most important part of my blabbering,  the ""REVIEW"" This place is always packed when you get here, So once you're in line make sure you know what you're getting because theres always a long line waiting to pass yah!!!! Steel city pops is the contemporary version of most ice cream shops because this establishment gives you the most diverse and uniqe style pops on the go for the urban world youth and older. When it comes serving up some mean popsicles they keep the crowd lining up constantly by bringing random and unique flavors such as butter cream, blueberry cream, pomegranate, coffee, banana, coconut and so on. Overall great concept, however, these popsicles just didn't really do it for me so for the character and uniqueness I still gave this place a whopping three stars!!"
1015,7/14/2014,Kayla B.,dallas-2,5,"My only complaint about this place is that it is so difficult to choose between all of their delicious sounding flavors. If you're in the mood for fruity, there is everything from blood orange to blueberry basil to strawberry balsamic (which is what I finally settled on-sweet with a tiny hint of vinegar,yum!). If creamy is more your thing, they have everything from classic vanilla bean to cherry sour cream, or my husband's favorite- coffee, topped with tiny granules of ground coffee. I can't wait to go back and try them all!"
1016,3/11/2015,A L.,dallas-2,5,Delicious gourmet popsicles with real fruit and ingredients. Even the ice cream ones are pretty decent. The workers are friendly too.
1017,10/15/2014,Lauren B.,dallas-2,5,SOOOOO YUMMY! These guys were at my work event and their popsicles are stupid good! I had the buttermilk flavor and my coworker had the pomegranate. The buttermilk one tasted a lot like cheesecake and I couldn't get enough of it. My coworker kept raving about hers as well. Delicious!!
1018,1/2/2015,Jonathan P.,dallas-2,5,"Lets just put it this way, I've never had a bad experience when grabbing a fun pop at Steel City.  My girlfriend and I's favorite are the White Chocolate and Blueberry Cream.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu!  Highly recommend to swing by if  you're ever in Lower Greenville and want something to cure your sweet tooth craving."
1019,8/30/2014,Mackenzi W.,dallas-2,5,"I've had the caramel and hibiscus flavors. The caramel was to die for. You cold see that they used vanilla bean as the little black specks settled at the top of the pop. The hibiscus had a better flavor the I expected, but I find myself leaning more towards the creamy pops."
1020,8/9/2014,Corey C.,dallas-2,4,"OMGG! The last G is for Good! I typically don't like pops but the blood orange was amazing and the Chocolate that my son had was the best I have ever tasted. We showed up at 5 minutes until closing and there was still a line out the door. It took about three minutes to get to the counter and make our selection.  Must stop if you are in the area. Only reason I gave it a 4 was limited selection.  But really,  how many can you eat in one day!!"
1021,8/1/2014,Molly B.,dallas-2,4,"A little pricey for Popsicles, but the flavors are delish! We had the coffee, chocolate and caramel on our first visit. Second visit we had strawberry (kinda plain) and blood orange- YUM! Be prepared to wait in line but worth it."
1022,7/6/2014,P. M.,dallas-2,5,"Wow, what an awesome find on a hot summer day!  I indulged in the chocolate cream flavor and it was outstanding.  The line was out the door and to the sidewalk but it moved very quickly.  The staff was kind and enthusiastic.  I'm looking forward to the next visit where I will be more adventurous in my flavor choice."
1023,6/10/2014,L D.,dallas-2,5,We had dinner at HG Supply and our server told us about this place since we decided against their dessert options.  I got a blueberry basil popsicle.  DELICIOUS!  As someone with a cow dairy allergy I was really happy to see so many dairy-free options available.  It was chock full of blueberry and just the right amount of sweetness to not overwhelm the blueberry or the basil.  I will definitely be back!
1024,6/6/2014,Matthew S.,dallas-2,5,"My new favorite thing. I've had the vanilla, cherry-sour-cream, and the blueberry-basil. Everything was awesome."
1025,6/21/2017,Eric W.,dallas-5,5,Healthy popsicles? We like it!The kids enjoyed all the fruit flavors. I enjoy the creamier ones=more calories :)But the pops all taste fresh!!Try it...
1026,8/1/2017,Ashley P.,dallas-5,4,"This place is so yummy! It's the cutest place to go out with a group of friends, for after dinner dates, or to bring your kids. There's indoor seating and outdoor seating so it's super kid friendly. The menu has many options to choose from. My husband loves the chocolate pop with the brownie in the middle, dipped in chocolate with peanuts. I like the water based pops. Recently I got the passion fruit pop and loved it. The menu is great. Excuse there is an option for everyone. The water-based ones have a lot of flavors to choose from that taste super fresh. I got the cucumber one and loved it but I wouldn't recommend it for everyone. Then there's chocolate or cake filled pops. You can choose to dip it in several different sauces, topIt with things like peanuts etc, and drizzle it with another sauce. I didn't know popcicles could have ever been considered gourmet but these certainly are!"
1027,5/20/2017,Josef M.,dallas-5,3,"$7.50 for two paletas (popsicles)?!?! Great value if served by the Dalai Lama and a gaggle of flying monkey servants... this is not the case.These popsicles are good, but not $3.00-$4.50 good. Fortunately for this business, they are located in an affluent neighborhood, so this is the closest they'll get to the quincentennial brown dude pushing the paletas cart. To help alleviate the suburban first-world problem of becoming too fat, they added the calorie count next to every menu entry.One thing they have going for them; They did not add all the childhood enjoyment buzzkill words like: gluten-free, paleo friendly, humanely harvested, fair trade, kosher, or whatever Gwyneth Paltrow BS they use nowadays.Swing by, enjoy, have fun... my wife is a customer, for me it's a one-time visit."
1028,9/30/2017,Laura S.,dallas-5,5,Found this by accident. So glad we did!!!Delicious pop flavors as a base and you can customize with other toppings. Combinations are endless!!!
1029,3/22/2017,Yolanda H.,dallas-5,5,"The new Preston & Royal location of Steel City Pops is a welcomed sight for me. I have been a fan of Steel City Pops for a while. It's nice to have a location in a North Dallas neighborhood to help deal with the upcoming Texas summer (which heat can easily start in the Spring). The pops are firm and flavorful. While the flavors may change with the season, they offer traditional juice type of popsicles (fruity) & creamy concoctions that remind me of a frozen dessert. The chocolate is a dream. The strawberry lemonade is perky addition to the palate. However, I have found that the odd sounding flavors became my fast favorites. The buttermilk reminds me of a cheesecake on a stick. The non-dairy avocado is a creamy pop made with lime so the taste is more like a key lime pie (but less sweet) rather than an avocado flavor. For coffee snobs, like myself, the coffee pop definitely delivered a solid sweet cafe au lait bite. **Insert happy dance here** . I saw a Hibiscus flavor on the menu, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they have it for my next visit. My taste buds are buzzing already.This location has limited indoor and outdoor seating if you want to enjoy a few pops with the family. I was pleased to learn of the loyalty program for Steel City Pops. After earning 10 stars, customers are awarded a free pop!"
1030,7/3/2017,Caroline H.,dallas-5,4,"Decided to try this place for the first time. Photos and reviews helped of course! I went to the Royal lane location since its closer by where I live. I think theres 3 locations in the area. I had got there and there were already a ton of people. Small place but quite inviting. The parking however was tight. I went ahead and got the 4 pop bag to go. I chose the blueberry basil, cucumber lime, coffee and oatmeal cream pie. I tried the cucumber lime first and it was good. Very strong flavor of cucumber and tartnest of the lime. Havnt tried the others yet but Im excited. There were so many to choose from that I would love to get but I had to limit myself!! Lol I would defiantly come back for sure and try other flavors. Great first time visit."
1031,9/18/2017,Desiree R.,dallas-5,5,Is a great place to visit as a vegetarian/vegan. The flavors are authentic and the pops taste so fresh. Love this little jewel!
1032,9/11/2017,Slowsteady S.,dallas-5,5,"Had something in LA & wished there was one in Dallas. Yay! Finally! The pops itself is not anything interesting , it looks like a plain simple pop. It's how you top it makes the magic! I chose coffee, dipped in dark chocolate, dredged with pistachios & dusted with sea salt! HEAVEN! The group sitting next to us had the pops without the toppings & I heard them saying ""there's nothing great about this"". It's true, there's nothing great if you just buy a simple plain pop but once you dip, dredge & dust with the many options available, it's nice. So be adventurous !"
1033,6/11/2017,Marcy A.,dallas-5,2,"The location of this Steel City Pops is great for families in the neighborhood, but I would rather go get ice cream somewhere else than eat one of their popsicles. Some of the flavors like banana have a funky after taste. The option to dip the popsicle in chocolate and add toppings is fun, but yet again I would rather go buy ice cream and add toppings to that."
1034,5/22/2017,Lacy G.,dallas-5,5,"What a great second location for this locally based ""chain""! Their pops are homemade, great tasting, and oh so good. There's indoor and outdoor seating at this location and it's a great place to grab a pop and window shop around the shopping strip. Super great flavors. I recommend the avocado... better than you'd think!!"
1035,4/21/2017,Amanda H.,dallas-5,5,This is such a cool and fun dessert option! They have fruity flavored Popsicles and creamy flavored Popsicles. They also have cake Popsicles. Now you can get your popsicle dipped and coated in something extra special. I love the pistachio popsicle when it is in season. But my go to is the BlackBerry popsicle. I have yet to have anything that wasn't delicious
1036,7/11/2017,Linda C.,dallas-5,5,The staff is very friendly and helpful! All were bubbly and inviting. Frida (if I remembered her name correctly) helped us with choosing flavors of the popsicles and answering any questions we may had about them! I had the Peach pop and it was really tasty!! Def coming back when we visit again!
1037,7/15/2017,Zarina B.,dallas-5,5,"Steel City Pops is this perfect place to cool off on a  hot summer day. The flavors of popsicles are all super fresh and tasty. The passionfruit is especially good. The price of 3$ may seem a little pricy, but the flavor and size of the pop makes it well worth it."
1038,6/22/2017,Nina V.,dallas-5,4,"A trip to Steel City Pops is a 'cool' way to find some refuge from the sweltering summer heat of Texas. They have dairy free and cream based pops in a variety of flavors. Some of my favorites are the buttermilk, blood orange and the strawberry lemonade. You can also customize your pop by having it dipped in one of three different types of chocolate: milk, white or dark and coated with toppings like pistachio, graham cracker crumbs etc. I personally like mine without the chocolate and toppings. The pops are fresh, intense in flavor and absolutely yummy!"
1039,5/26/2017,Emily Z.,dallas-5,5,"Coffee - lighter flavor than normal coffee ice cream, but it's really nice! Perfect for a hot summer day."

Updated review",Christine S.,dallas-5,5,Loved this place!  The pops were amazing and they had lots of great flavors to pick from.  The coconut and Avocado are my favorite!!! .  We will definitely be back for more.
1041,5/28/2017,Taylor H.,dallas-5,4,"I really love the popsicles here! I've had strawberry and raspberry lemon- neither disappointed. Everyone who ordered in front of me had theirs dipped in chocolate so I'm sure that's yummy, too! However, they were out of a few flavors when I went (my husband couldn't get cookies and cream) - so that was a little disappointing considering they weren't closing for a couple more hours and my husband waited in line for 5 minutes or so before he was told. Great concept tho! Love the flavor of the month idea!"
1042,7/29/2017,Bob A.,dallas-5,3,"Not sure if it was the flavor, but the chocolate brownie was okay.  I could imaging the other flavors being better.  Aside the wait, it was a good experience.  Just for the value flavor on this trip, it was not exciting."
1043,6/19/2017,Peggy J.,dallas-5,5,OMG - peanut butter pie with caramel drizzle.  I am in heaven. Everyone in our party loved what they ordered. Raves for the oatmeal cream pie with white chocolate and the cookies and cream. I was skeptical - but our grandkids wanted to go.  I will. E back!
1044,5/21/2017,Ankita P.,dallas-5,5,"Love SCP! I've been here several times, and I've loved just about everything I've tried! Highly recommend the Peanut Butter or Blood Orange pops!"
1045,9/17/2017,Shawniece H.,garland,5,"When my best friend suggested Steel City Pops during a weekend trip o Dallas, I was less than enthusiastic about it. 1. My heart belongs to Nicey Treat in Indy. 2. I didn't get the whole dip, dredge, drizzle thing.I am SO glad I went with her! I didn't make it very far into the store before I saw the sign for the Pop of the month: Chocolate Salted Caramel Cheesecake. It is a buttermilk pop, dipped in chocolate, dredged with graham cracker, drizzled with caramel, and dusted with sea salt. It's basically an entire meal in the form of a popsicle.  Needless to say, I enjoyed it. The staff was very friendly. I think they saw the unsure expression on my face and offered suggestions and modifications before I decided to trust their judgment. If you're in Dallas, GO THERE NOW!!!"
1046,6/26/2017,Samantha L.,garland,5,"Just an all around great product for the money you shell out. Each popsicle has creamy, satisfying chunks of fruit, yet each individual flavor is on point and absolutely unmistakable. I always ask the most annoying question the cashier ever gets: ""What do you recommend?"" Hasn't failed me yet. xoxo"
1047,6/9/2017,John N.,garland,4,"In a hot texas day without any breeze, and you're tired of drinking bubble tea what do you do?Steel city pops is a great way to cool down, with some great premade flavors and an option to build your own just like the popular pop bar chain in california.I got the coconut pop and everything is 3 dollars, it had great coconut flavor and wasnt too overly sweet. I also tried the coffee one, which had a good balance between sweet and bitter.The service was inconsistent, the owner looked really nice and happy, while the other employee looked like she didnt want to be there. All in all a great place to cool down :DNote* they also have some dried ice and insulated bags for togo. Really cool!"
1048,9/26/2017,Jacki M.,garland,4,Such a fun place to come in the summer and grab a pop.  They make their own flavors with the best ingredients.  You can get regular pops or creamy pops for a more indulgent experience.  They also have seasonal flavors too!
1049,9/23/2017,Matt B.,garland,5,"Popsicles for adults. This place is amazing. They make all their own flavors. They range from fruity to creamy and even some strange ones. They have different flavors through out the year and seasonal ones as well. My favorite one is the pineapple jalapeño. Sweet, spicy and superb."
1050,9/7/2017,Jennie J.,garland,5,Yuuuuuumm!! These are truly unique popsicles! They have different flavors and you can even add toppings to your popsicle! Dairy-free options are available. The avocado flavor is dairy-free and is SO delicious!!!!!! Try any flavor! You can't possibly be disappointed.
1051,7/31/2017,Manny P.,garland,5,"These pops are AMAZING especially on a hot Texas summer day! They offer a variety of fruity & creamy flavors. If you like the creamy flavors, try the buttermilk pop!! It's sooo good."
1052,7/29/2017,Chi Chi O.,garland,5,Their pops are the best I've had I a long time. Very unique flavors. VERY tasty. The customer service was... a little iffy. But overall it was really nice.
1053,11/19/2016,Kathy L.,garland,5,$3 bucks for each reg pop and cookie pops are $4.50. The gal that greeted us was nice and helpfulI wanted something nutty or had nuts in it. She recommended the Cashew pop- creamy and has bits towards the end. It was interesting but really good. Never had anything like it before in texture or taste. Would come again to try other pops!
1054,7/26/2017,Carmelita C.,garland,5,Love that we have a Steel City Pops near us! The staff is amazing and always so nice and helpful. Tonight we took my brother for his birthday and it was of course delicious! Also very clean and since we decided to take our pops home they gave us a travel cooling bag that kept pur pops frozen till we got home. This was so thoughtful and we will definitely be back.
1055,6/28/2016,Katina D.,garland,4,"It's 101 degrees outside and I'm craving a sweet treat... Something that won't make me feel guilty especially since it's the middle of bikini season! I loved the Steel City Pops located in Dallas and I'm so glad I was able to have a Popsicle while yelping the Garland area. The fire wheel location is tucked into the shopping centers so make sure you keep your eyes open ! I ordered my usual plain Jane strawberry Popsicle and it was a perfect summer treat. Did I forget to mention that it was only 79 calories??? Two birds and one stone would be the perfect quote to describe it! The staff was really friendly and helpful if one ever needed a flavor suggestion. Overall: I will continue to come back to Steel City Pops for some more Popsicles but preferably to the Dallas location. I love love loveeeee this place, especially during the hot summer!"
1056,7/19/2017,Kaelie P.,garland,5,"Cute little stop with a flagrant flare in aesthetics through creamery-style decor, small contoured seat bar stools against the window (limited seating) and vintage coffee shop type menu board layout. They have organic popsicles that you can dress up with extra flavors or treats but be warned - if your allergic to anything such as peaches, nuts, pecans and the like you should avoid ""dredging"" your popsicle. All icicles are prepackaged to prevent cross contamination, however the process to dress up your pop isn't as streamlined. This place makes a nice stop if you need something organic, fruity and single serve to beat the heat during the summer while you shop around."
1057,6/30/2017,Eric E.,garland,5,Great way to cool off in the Texas heat! Plus rewards for every popsicle you buy here.  Strawberry lemonade is the best!
1058,7/27/2016,Ashlee S.,garland,4,"Warning: it's extremely difficult to pick a flavor! You'll want to try them all. There's nothing like a ice cold Popsicle to beat the Texas heat.The Popsicles are always very cold, but not so hard that you can't bite into it. The variety of flavors is quite large, and I usually stick to the basics. This night I had the cherry sour cream  which as usual, was full of flavor and fruity goodness. I liked my husbands more, he had the vanilla one. I really want to try the raspberry lemonade and strawberry shortcake flavors. I like that they are always coming out with something new too. Price is $3 a pop."
1059,12/5/2016,Khanh D.,garland,3,"I've been to the Greenville location and enjoyed that much better. We came here recently bc it is much closer to us. The service was okay...I wanted to try the avocado cream pop but they were out. My sister wanted to try the jalapeño one and that too was either out or was not served at this location. I ended up getting the carrot cake flavored pop, my sis got coffee and my niece got the strawberry lemonade. The carrot cake was overly sweet and rich. The other two pops I was told were good. I'd rather go to the one on Greenville as the vibe is much more fun but will settle for this location if I'm craving for a pop badly."
1060,7/22/2017,Florencia S.,garland,4,"Great pops! You can choose from fruity and creamy flavors (and dips, drizzles, etc). The service was great to top it off!"
1061,8/18/2017,Stella N.,garland,1,I went in since I heard such great reviews about this place. Disappointed because the young girl assisting me was really rushing me eventhough I had just walked inn and have never seen the menu before. Very harsh attitude. Will not be returning
1062,5/19/2016,Allie Y.,garland,4,"You will like Steel City Pops if you like Popsicles with quality. They have varieties of flavors that change everyday and they have the flavors divided from fruity to milky on their menu board. They always have bright young people working here who will nicely help you if you have any questions. One thing I really like about steel city pop is their clean pricing. The pops are $3 each and all their prices are tax included! I think the whole US should adopt this idea to be honest. Although their Popsicles are good and refreshing, I feel like it's been way overhyped as if people never had a good Popsicle before. I've had some better and creative ones in Hawaii so the concept wasn't anything new to me. Anyway, you know if you're ice cream, fro yo, shaved ice, or Popsicle person and if you like Popsicles in general, you will like this place! My favorite so far is the lime flavor!"
1063,6/7/2017,Sidney G.,garland,4,"The popsicles are very interesting, however I wish they had samples. I got the honeydew (a summer season popsicle) and I really liked the unique texture, although I wish it would have had more flavor. They do have a good variety of light and heavier popsicles."
1064,5/16/2017,Stacey F.,garland,5,This place is awesome!  We were introduced to Steel City Pops when we visited friends in Alabama. We were so excited to find out there is a location so close to where we live.  There are many flavors to choose from. Check out the flavor of the month!
1065,5/7/2017,L Q.,garland,5,"Wow! So many flavors and toppings! My son got peanut butter dipped in chocolate, my daughter got banana dipped in chocolate with pecans and toasted coconut, her bf got passion fruit. They all loved their pops...and they're a picky crowd. The clerk answered all our questions and was patient while we made our choices. I wasn't feeling well so declined a pop for myself. The clerk suggested I take it home for later. I was concerned that it would melt before we got home since we had several stops on the way and it was hot outside. She put it in a special bag with an ice pack and guaranteed it would still be frozen in an hour. We took nearly an hour to get home and it was still frozen, not even a drip! The bag looks like a paper bag with a zipper closure, but it must be magic!! We got there 30 mins before closing time and the store was clean and sparkling, even the baseboards and window frames. I'm really tall, so I see the tops of things most people can't. There wasn't a dust bunny or cobweb up high or down low, and most places have a cobweb up high, but not here. I felt comfortable letting my family eat something from here and I'm real picky about that. We'll be back!"
1066,7/26/2017,Jo Anna C.,garland,5,"Went to SCPops Garland tonight.  Let's hear it for the two sisters who were working to serve us!  Fun and quick service. Great customer care!  Knew the product and answered all our questions.  Loved the peach cream and then the coconut. . .Thanks for having best popsicle ever, and thanks for having such a wonderfully train staff!"
1067,3/8/2017,Andy W.,garland,5,I have a family of 6 and we love dropping in about 2-3 times a month. The service is tremendously friendly. Efficient. Quality. You cannot ask for more from a popsicle place!

Updated review",Lisa K.,garland,5,"Today we had banana pudding, it was good but light on the flavor. My daughter had Cinnamon Apple and it was scrumptious!!!  Like fresh made apple sauce!!!  Can't wait to come back and try one dipped in chocolate and rolled in pecans and coconut!  They have so many new things to do with your pop!!!!!  And many different toppings and flavors. You won't be sorry!!!!"
1069,8/19/2015,Pauline P.,garland,4,"Steel City Pops is so refreshing especially in this summer heat. Since all of the ""fruity"" popsicles are basically less than 100 calories (minus the pineapple jalapeño), you don't feel guilty indulging in this sweet treat. I've only tried the passion fruit, coconut and the orange mint green tea but they all were awesome. I definitely didn't think I would like the orange mint green tea but somehow the flavor blended well together to make one awesome popsicle. My only beef with Steel City is that it's $3 a popsicle...but regardless I'm still a fan."
1070,6/28/2015,Catherine H.,garland,5,"Great place! I'm so glad they put one in Firewheel because it's close so we don't have to drive all the way to Dallas and the mall needs something like this here. We came here on a Sunday night and since the mall was closed most people came to get the pops. They were $3 a pop which is kinda pricy but it works and there's not really tax so if you get one its $3 straight up and simple which is something I like. The environment was very friendly and the boards were all decorated with fruity flavors, cream based flavors and cookie flavors. They open the pops for you and hand it to you with the stick facing you and throw the wrapper away which was sweet of them. We liked it so much we came back again within 10 minutes. We got strawberries and cream, vanilla bean, buttermilk, and coconut. All very good! The coconut has toasted coconut flakes through out the Pop. Will visit again for sure!"
1071,5/13/2017,Josh Y.,garland,4,"Came here after dinner, and the line was out the door.  A specialty shop specialized in gourmet popsicles.  They have fruity pops and creamy pops.  I personally preferred the creamy pops.  I got lemon cream.  It was delicious and lemony.  I also decided to try Chai Latte.  Chai latte was also delicious with a very strong creamy chai flavor.  However, the only problem in my opinion was they were not creamy enough.  I was expecting the creamy pops to be like ice cream bars, but it was not quite as creamy."
1072,3/23/2017,Cynthia B.,garland,5,I went in at random one day after reading something about a grand opening of one of the other Dallas area locations! My kids had root beer float and I had pineapple jalapeño! Both flavors were delicious! I can't wait to try more!
1073,7/18/2016,Tracy T.,garland,4,"SCP definitely grew on me. When this location first opened, I was appalled that I had to pay $4 for a block of frozen juice. But then as the summers got hotter and I began to crave the sweet, icy coolness of SCP. I rarely ever come to this location, but instead almost always get my fix from the stand at Klyde Warren Park on Saturdays! My favorite is the mango. Super refreshing, super yummy, and super good when it's 100 degrees outside and you're trying to stay cool at the park."
1074,7/13/2016,Emily H.,garland,5,"Visited Steel City Pops today for the first time, and tried the coffee pop. SO GOOD! I'm normally not much of a Popsicle person, but it really hit the spot. Quick service and relatively cheap. Will visit again!"
1075,5/31/2016,Lance A.,garland,5,Just tried the coffee Popsicle at Clyde Warren. Going to try more. Believe the hype (as far as Popsicles go).
1076,2/25/2017,Qendrim B.,garland,5,"I came in tonight right before closing and the worker made me an awesome pop with ""the works""- vanilla popsicle dipped in milk chocolate and dredged in toasted coconut with a caramel drizzle. Awesome."
1077,11/8/2015,Thi Q.,garland,4,"I was so happy when they open this location, still far but closer than the one in uptown. Been here a couple times and the worker was friendly and helpful every time. I've tried a variety of flavor, based on the worker suggestion and they were on point every time. I also like their point card, buy 10 pops and receive 1 free/ buy 10 four packs get a 4 pack free."
1078,5/8/2016,Natalie T.,garland,5,"I always enjoy a great sweet treat, and this place definitely offers it. Whenever I visit Dallas, I make it a must to stop by Steel City Pops. I have tried their blackberry and it was definitely delicious and refreshing. The flavors they offer are never too sweet. The service is great as well. There really is nothing negative to say about this place."
1079,10/11/2016,Stu D.,garland,5,"If I am ever in the mood for desserty items this is where I will go.  You can get some a varied array of flavors in the same delivery system, and you can bet that it will taste like what the description says, no artificial stuff here."
1080,8/12/2015,Elizabeth K.,garland,5,Delicious. Got pineapple jalapeño and strawberry pops. They were both amazing!!!! $3 a Popsicle!Great service. The guy at the register offered to exchange my Popsicle if I didn't like it. But it was a great balance of fruit and zing. The strawberry Popsicle was lie eating fresh strawberries!
1081,4/4/2016,Kelly T.,garland,5,"SCP is super refreshing.  My favorite so far are mango, guava, and coconut.You really can't go wrong with any of the flavors but those are a must-have!"
1082,9/10/2016,Nancy N.,garland,4,Very tasty. The coconut was delish. And I got to try my friend's vanilla bean and it was also super tasty can't wait to try other flavors!
1083,7/20/2015,Johnny T.,garland,4,Never been to the steel city pops in dallas but have always had an itching to try it since people were telling me how good they were.Ventured out to the fire wheel location to try it on opening day and grabbed the avocado pop. Wasn't that good in my opinion the only thing that shocked me was how I spent 3 dollars and it wasn't all that.Tried it another time after that and got the vanilla bean pop and that was extremely delicious. Still not worth 3$ though
1084,8/22/2016,Amber W.,garland,5,Love Steel City Pops. First came into contact with them in Birmingham. Thrilled to find them here!Cucumber lime and lavender lemonade were delish!
1085,3/14/2017,Leea T.,garland,2,"I love the other locations in Dallas, but I'm not sure that I'll ever go to the Garland location again.  The last two times that I've been there, the place was filthy...the trashcan was overflowing, there was melted popsicles all over the floor and the place looked like it hadn't been swept or mopped in months.  The same girl was behind the counter and was the only employee there both times. She was slumped over the counter looking bored during both visits.She just didn't seem to care about anything and it was very clear that she didn't know much about the products.  She repeatedly assured me that milk chocolate contains no dairy and is safe for my daughter with a dairy allergy (""I texted someone and they said that it's just milk chocolate and coconut oil""). She apparently attempted to text someone about this, but didn't tell us this and just left us standing there.  Another customer walked in at one point and she didn't even look up...she started talking to them like she thought they were us.   Yesterday they were out of strawberry, mango and coconut pops, as well as 2 of the ingredients necessary to make the advertised special.  I love Steel City Pops and I hope they're not going to let all of their stores decline the way this one has."
1086,10/6/2015,Jessica D.,garland,3,"There has been a lot of hype about Steel City Pops and finally, they built a location right next to me. Unfortunately they were out of a lot of flavors I wanted to try (vanilla chocolate chip, vanilla bean, avocado and cranberry orange) so I resorted to trying coffee. The popsicles were reasonably priced, $3 for normal ones and $4.50 for the cookie ones). My coffee flavored popsicle was creamy and had a good coffee flavor with little coffee grinds. Overall, good but nothing amazing. I do plan on returning to try other flavors to see if any of them are worth the rave."
1087,2/25/2017,Omar B.,garland,5,"Tonight was my first time at steel city pops, and the experience was WONDERFUL- the pops were amazing and the service was even better. Next time you come in, ask for Madi  She was so helpful and told us the whole history of steel city and how it started in Birmingham"
1088,6/13/2016,Jason R.,garland,5,Best Popsicles!!!   Every flavor is amazing. The pineapple and strawberry are my go to on a hot day as they don't melt too fast either.   I haven't had one bad one from this place. Obviously don't try a flavor profile you don't like at all cause you won't like it.
1089,8/29/2015,Ruth M.,garland,3,We have been here a couple of times.  There are so many flavors to try and so far everything we have tried has been yummy.The pops are $3 a piece of a 12pk for $33.  I asked the sales clerk how much it was for 12 and she started to do crazy math.  She was not sure of either my question or what the cost was for 12.Get their punch card-well be back for sure.
1090,7/4/2016,Maitlyn P.,garland,5,Get the chai latte!! It has tons of cinnamon on top and is really creamy. Coconut is also delicious. They also had strawberry balsamic which I'm excited to try next.
1091,9/6/2015,Debbie J.,garland,5,"This place is truly my happy place.  I love the passion fruit, jalapeno pineapple and the coffee pops.  Excellent location! Also, I love the calorie count posted on the menu.Thank you Steel City Pops!"
1092,7/21/2015,Nhi P.,garland,3,"Always heard about the Dallas location so once they opened in Garland, I decided to take my brother and his girlfriend. He got Strawberry Cream, she got Chocolate Brownie and I got the Coffee Brownie.. I think this place is overly hyped along with a lot of other places in DFW!Maybe it was the flavors we got but I'll definitely give it another try!"
1093,8/27/2015,Esther A.,garland,5,"Sorry no pics! It was that good! I had the Creamy Pina Colada, it was so yummy! Coconut pieces, my friend had the Creamy Peach! She devoured that! Like I said it was so good we forgot to take pictures! Plus the sweet guy working there named Simon was such a great pleasure to talk to. I wish him all the best in the medical field! I hope he gets a chance to read this! For 2 best friends who are Mom's and wives now, just getting away after a long time apart, this was a great ending to our lunch date! It reminded us sorda of our moms making juice pops for us. But yummier! If that's even a word!"
1094,6/9/2016,Kristina S.,garland,4,"Great popsicles, but disappointed that last couple times they were out of sweet tea popsicle. Customer service is great! Katie is always spectacular at suggesting flavors."
1095,6/30/2015,Laura O. D.,garland,3,"After reading the company's Bio on their website, everything made sense. This business was started by a family that went to Nashville,TN to try Mexican paletas, then started a storefront in Alabama.I grew up here in Dallas, TX where if I heard chiming bells and ran out of my house fast enough, I could catch the Paleta Man and buy a savory paleta for $1. (Which was made of real fruit/ juice also.) What I tried here at Steel City Pops is a poor impression of an authentic paleta. Not really impressed."
1096,6/20/2015,Frances P H.,garland,5,Very thrilled about the opening of the Garland location and how much closer it is to home compared to other locations. Staff was very friendly and helpful. They informed me the Popsicles were all organic and that makes me fell so much better about what I'm eating so why not indulge right? They had a large selection of flavors and I couldn't decide on just one so I got 4 to go and they give you these little sacks that keep your Popsicles chill for up to 20 minutes. They also give out frequent buyer punch cards so I have a feeling I'll be here a lot this summer!
1097,7/19/2015,Ai Vy N.,garland,3,"I have been to the other location in the lower greenville, can't help but have to compare this one to it, and have to give this one 3 stars out of 5 instead of anything higher. First of, they have veryyyyyy limited outside seating, one bench to be exact, and i wouldnt even consider it as a patio seating. It's a shame tho for being in the middle of Firewheel. Would be perfect to sit outside, enjoy the weather (not this time of year tho of course) and people watch.Second, their customer service needs improvement. Not as friendly, energetic, or detailed as the one in lower greenville. They only cut the bag open for you and just hand over the whole thing like that. It's not that I'm lazy and don't want to take 1 sec to pull the Popsicle out of the bag, and another 5 secs looking around for a trash can to throw the bag away. It's about the principle! If you're gonna have a chain establishment, everything better be the same across the board, have some kind of procedures/guideline so the employees can follow. Alrighty, enough ranting, i did enjoy my guacamole popsicle (eventho i thought it was limeade at first after a few bites), n it was a good surprise to find out about another Steel City Pop. I shall rest my case."
1098,6/23/2016,Anthony C.,garland,5,Great place to cool off and have a great treat. This is my 2nd visit to the Garland Firewheel location.  My daughter didn't like her selection and they exchanged it for free.  (Store Policy)  The value vs. price is good.
1099,4/9/2016,Mays K.,garland,4,"Maybe 1 in the last 5 times I went, they had their cookie pop available. I only drive to steel city for the cookie pop and it's my, and prob many others, favorite....I feel like if you know you always run out of a popular item by mid afternoon, you should bother to start making more! Also if you call ahead, they literally never answer. Other than that I adore the Popsicles - seriously try them, soooo good, even if you don't like Popsicles. and the employees are always knowledgable and awesome!! :)"
1100,4/9/2016,G G.,garland,5,"SO GOOD! I've tried almost all the flavors and my favorites are avocado, coconut, and chocolate, but I haven't tried one I didn't like. Overall a nice and inexpensive place to get fresh popsicles"
1101,11/15/2016,Nilda O.,garland,5,great variety of flavors. my go to place when want to grab some savory and yummy Popsicle!
1102,2/20/2016,Wayne Y.,garland,5,"Great place! Turned a grumpy 3 year old frown into a smile and the 12 year old loved the chocolate popsicle.  My wife and I loved our Popsicles and the server was nice, friendly and helpful."
1103,10/8/2016,Elizabeth C.,garland,3,"We went because I wanted to have coconut flavor , they didn't have it , two girls were there but I was thick they had poor customer service like they didn't want to work , I feel kind of disappointed because I didn't get the flavor and poor customer service"
1104,3/7/2016,Amanda W.,garland,5,"Pretty awesome Popsicles. Great flavors, real ingredients.  We like the avocado, blueberry cream, and sweet tea best."
1105,9/25/2016,Katie B.,garland,5,"Fabulous popsicles! We had peanut butter, root beer and strawberry, couldn't have been happier! Friendly staff, reasonable prices, will be back for sure!"
1106,11/16/2015,Andrew K.,garland,5,"Best Popsicles ever!! Highly recommended. I love how they let you trade your pop in if you don't like it, but what me and all of my friends truly wish for, was mini toothpick pop samples!"
1107,2/18/2016,Ashley R.,garland,4,"Great, inexpensive popsicles with several different flavor options! My favorites are the sweet tea and coffee!"
1108,7/6/2016,Melody L.,garland,5,"Great surprise for my grandson after a disappointing trip to Lunar Golf.  (See my review for details).  Fortunately, Steel City had just what we needed after getting over heated.  Cool and cold pops and bottled water were a hit with all of us--young and old.  Strawberry Lemonade, Chocolate and Coconut were all yummy.  We'll be back!"
1109,12/9/2015,Ashley D.,garland,5,"Love this place. The watermelon popsicle is to die for! The line is always out the for, but the service is quick and the wait isn't bad at all."
1110,6/5/2016,Jeromey L.,garland,5,"I was finally able to get a pop from here.  Every other time I tried, the line was way too long to wait now I know why.  These are not just Popsicles they are gourmet Popsicles if those two words can be put together with a straight face.  I can't wait to go back and try other flavors I'll have to take some home next time."
1111,6/28/2015,Michele B.,garland,5,"I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama (the birthplace of SCP) and I absolutely love Steel City Pops!!! I am so excited to introduce them to my Texas friends. They are refreshing and delicious! A perfect summertime treat. We had avocado and banana tonight and both were delicious."
1112,8/3/2015,Laura M.,garland,4,"I had the avocado cream pop and my boyfriend had the lime pop and i must say it was very good. The price was alot more than i had expected. It was pretty busy when i went, but we quickly got taken care of."
1113,4/9/2016,Pam V.,garland,5,"The best refreshing $3 treat when shopping at Firewheel.  I have had the coffee, strawberry, and cucumber lime pops.  All have been delicious.  Will definitely continue to return."
1114,11/6/2015,Chris T.,garland,5,"I love sweets, and I live in Texas so I love cold treats. Steel city pops saved my life over the summer. They sell these awesome little popsicles that are separated into two categories: creamy and fruity. I prefer the creamy ones for taste, however most of the time I get the fruity ones because I try to be healthy and they have less calories. The creamy popsicles are rich and delicious. My favorite and a definite must is the chocolate chip cookie pop. It's a brick of chocolate chip cookie surrounded by vanilla ice cream, honestly I would be surprised if they eat this in heaven. The fruity pops are great also and they are a bit lighter. I love the pina colada flavor and how refreshing it is. If you go here once then you'll be going here quite often for sure soon after. With that noted I would recommend getting a punch card because you can score a significant amount of free pops with one punchcard. Although these pops are seemingly on the expensive side at $3 dollars a piece, they are worth it because of the quality ingredients and great flavor. Give this place a shot and you won't regret it. The only thing you regret is not going sooner."
1115,11/9/2015,Sarah A.,garland,5,We had a good experience there. Simple a fast! The guy that helps us is nice. I love taking my daughter every once in a while.
1116,7/13/2015,Jackie N.,garland,4,So excited they've opened a location at Firewheel! Much easier for my popsicle cravings since it's close to my house. I like that they use organic ingredients and have an array of flavors. The fruity flavors are light and tart and creamy is good and rich. I would say the creamy avocado tastes more like avocado-lime but still yummy. $3 per pop and the workers remove the plastic and hand it to you.
1117,8/15/2015,Rocio S.,garland,4,"Paletas are nothing new to me. Grew up eating them and we go to the Mexican paleterias every so often. But this place uses organic ingredients, which is a big plus for me. The flavors we tried were strawberry shortcake, watermelon, cantaloupe, and chocolate. All were so rich and so filling. It was our first time, but next time we go, we are splitting one. After eating half of it, we needed a bottle of water. The strawberry shortcake was so creamy and the shortcake inside was too rich for me, but it was delicious. Watermelon and cantaloupe were very sweet. The chocolate one was my fave. My daughter had that one. I think we are good for a couple of months, but definitely want to try their other flavors. I love that it's so close to home."
1118,11/30/2016,Henry Y.,casa-linda-dallas,5,"Wow. A whole lot more than flavored ice, these pops are super dense and heavy and crazily flavorful. Way better than Milk and Wood and all the lackeys in the bay area. We went in to try just one, but after 2 bites in the car, we rushed back out to buy another one. Was the first one a Pomegranate Rosemary ? The second was Strawberry Fig.  Both were heavenly. And substantial! We were full after eating them. As soon as we reached Austin, I had to look, and noticed there's one in the Barton Springs area. Unfortunately it was closed the one day we were in Austin."

Updated review",Frankie Q.,casa-linda-dallas,4,"I really enjoyed this place. I know that seems so unlike most of my reviews but its not often that I can go somewhere and have little to no complaints. The storefront was nice and clean, orderly. The girls working were nice, knowledgeable and quick when it got busy. They even went the extra mile and washed out a Popsicle holder that my husband purchased for our son. Its the little details that matter to me.Though I want to complain I can't find a single thing, that's one in a million for an opinionated lady such as myself.We got 2 avocado popcicles & 1 oatmeal cream pie. They weren't too sweet, super creamy and way addictive. I can definitely see myself trying everything on the menu, OK I probably will. Don't judge"
1120,6/11/2017,Jay C.,casa-linda-dallas,4,"Was there late last night 9:40pm ( they close at 10pm) and I'm glad they open late. My kids wereCraving Ice cream I was able to convince them to try this place and they loved it. They didn't go crazy with toppings just plain old pops, I'm glad they didn't because I would have had one hell of the night. Great staffs, clean environment. Will be back for more!"
1121,8/19/2016,Susan T.,casa-linda-dallas,5,Had to have a Coffee Pop. We(the girls) are trying very flavor. Love having a little piece of heaven and people watch at the same time. Now have sitting outside. Fun for all the family!!!!!!
1122,6/28/2017,P P.,casa-linda-dallas,2,"Popsicles are delicious, however the cashiers don't have any customer service skills. Very rude! Will not be back to that location."
1123,5/18/2017,Briana R.,casa-linda-dallas,4,This place is so good! They have interesting fruit favors. I loved the hibiscus. I'll definitely be back
1124,7/29/2016,Arlene M.,casa-linda-dallas,5,"I mean, come on!  Who doesn't love a pop!  But these all are amazing gourmet pops!  Ive had several flavors, but I keep going back to buttermilk.  New flavors like guava and lavender lemonade have me wanting to come back soon.  I witnessed a lady who bought all the Cherry sour cream and other flavors in two of the large styrofoam containers.  When i said ""somebody loves Steel City Pops!"" ,  she said she was having a garage sale and all the people who are helping her are getting rewarded for their efforts.  Excellent reward!  Took my friend for her first time and she absolutely loved the blackberry.  She's sold on this fantastic pop shop and will bring her hubby next time.  They crowd hit after we sat down to eat.  But the young ladies were quick to help everyone."
1125,7/9/2016,Lauren B.,casa-linda-dallas,1,Went to grab a quick pop before they were gonna close and I arrived 10 minutes before they're supposed to close and the door was locked. Both employees were sitting at the front counter and didn't even acknowledge me. I am very disappointed because I have had excellent service at the location on Greenville. Guess this is the location to avoid in regards to customer service.EDITED:I changed the location from Bishop Arts to Greenville.
1126,3/19/2016,Dj A.,casa-linda-dallas,5,"I loved the location of the store and its unique style. I experienced wonderful customer service and the inside was so clean.    I also have to say that the ice cream was about $3 but you certainly are getting what you pay for. They have numerous flavors that are so tasty like coconut, buttermilk, and chocolate!!!   The employee working at the time I went was so helpful and friendly! I truly think I'll be coming back for another round of ice cream pops!!"
1127,7/10/2016,Los Y.,casa-linda-dallas,5,I am in love with these Popsicles. There is not a bad flavor. I feel like I've tried every flavor and I have never been disappointed. The staff was nice and very helpful. I had a question about big orders and how to keep them from melting and they had great plans and suggestions. I boys love coming here. Sitting outside and enjoying their pops. I'm glad there is a close location to Plano. I hope to keep enjoying these wonderful treats and look forward to a Plano location.
1128,6/5/2016,Bade B.,casa-linda-dallas,4,I had the caramel Popsicle it was so great I like this place the price is also good. I will be back soon.
1129,7/6/2016,Nikkita R.,casa-linda-dallas,5,Loved it! They also let you exchange your Popsicle for another if you don't like the first one you bought! Vanilla Bean is the best!!
1130,12/13/2016,Donella K.,casa-linda-dallas,5,"easy location to park - wonderful service, a great fun treat anytime.  enjoy all flavors there"
1131,7/6/2016,Helen B.,casa-linda-dallas,4,"Really great flavor for the popsicles, and the price is decent. The store is cute & the customer service is good. My only complaint is that there's limited room to eat them inside. My mother is not not able to climb stairs easily, so I'm not sure how much room was upstairs to sit or stand. We headed outside since the area downstairs was packed, and we were bummed by how fast our popsicles melted in the Texas heat. Not any fault of Steel City Pops, of course, just super disappointed there was no room inside to eat them."
1132,7/12/2017,Briana P.,austin,5,"This is the perfect stand addition to this food park. We finished hiking on the Greenbelt, we were pouring sweat and we all said ""POPSICLES"". This stand is hard to see from the road and even a bit difficult from the parking lot. It is tucked away between two big food trucks so make sure you don't just drive away because you don't see it (like we almost did!)Despite it being a packed Sunday afternoon at the food truck park, they were not out of any flavors. They had a good mix of creamy and water based. Our group got peaches and cream, avocado, chocolate and wait for it....pineapple jalapeño. I just had to! I was hesitant, but the sweet guy running the stand said if I didn't like it, I could come back and just choose another one. That is good business! Well, I ended up liking it! One thing I will say is it does pack some heat, so maybe it wasn't the smartest choice coming off from a sweaty hike (didn't get that refreshing relief).  Still good though!Make sure to grab a spot in the shade to enjoy those SCP. With this Texas heat, you are in a race against time to see whether you or the ground gets more of that delish popsicle."
1133,7/6/2017,Josh L.,austin,5,"Wow! I've been looking for a good popsicle place around Austin, and I have heard the buzz about this place many times. Conveniently located in the food truck area along Barton Springs Rd., this place is a great place to go after spending a couple of hours at the Rowing Dock (go see my other review for this one!)My parents and I came one day on a hot July afternoon to Steel City, and I recognized one of my friends from UT, Hilarie, there working the stand. She was really nice and offered us some great flavors from the Blood Orange to the Watermelon Popsicles. I enjoyed both of these popsicles, not too sweet, but just a nice cool bite for a hot afternoon.Be aware of the hours (12-4 and 6-9!) So time your day accordingly and grab yourself one or two popsicles!"
1134,9/22/2017,K N.,austin,5,"Had them come out for my wedding two months ago and it was such a hit! We have them in Dallas where I'm from, so I know what it tastes like...but all of our guests from out of town/out of state loved it as well. They came in their cute little cart with the cute umbrella! The guy working it was also in their cute outfit! Setting it up was also so fast and easy. It was just lovely and perfect."
1135,7/1/2017,Cynthia C.,austin,5,Fell in love with this place in Dallas! Austin Popsicle cart was just as good!!! Great customerservice! The pineapple jalapeño was way too spicy for me but loved the blood orange pop and can't wait for them to bring in their cookie pops!!!
1136,6/14/2017,Jennifer A.,austin,5,Yum! This was our first time in Austin and we happened by a food truck park after leaving Barton Springs Pools. My youngest son got the creamy coconut pop and I got peach. They were delicious! It's $3 per popsicle if I remember correctly.
1137,6/2/2017,Sunny K.,austin,4,"They have limited menu (not really an actual food truck it's just a cart of 7-8 diff flavors), but I still enjoyed mine. I've been to steel city in htx, and this was my first time going to the one in atx.-parking available (it's at a food truck park)-cash or card-no indoor area, but outdoor shade with fans-friendly staff"
1138,6/26/2016,Christina B.,austin,5,"I'm so glad they brought Steel City Pops to Austin from Dallas. :) I was a big fan of them back in Dallas, so of course I had to check out this small popsicle stand. Steel City Pops is located in the food truck area called The Picnic where they have Kebabalicious, Mighty Cone, and Brunch Haus to name a few. It really is a small black cart with one person manning it. Being small, they do run out of flavors!I had the coconut as recommended by the worker, and it was a great choice. Very creamy, coconut-y, and rich. I enjoyed the addition of actual toasted coconut flakes too! My boyfriend had the champagne white tea popsicle. By champagne they mean the tea leaves, not the alcohol haha. This popsicle is one of the icy ones vs the creamy kind that I had. It was still good though! I honestly feel like after being so spoiled by first-class popsicles like these that I can't eat any of the popsicles from the standard supermarket anymore, haha. They accept both cash and credit!"
1139,6/30/2016,Caroline K.,austin,5,"Wow, wow, WOW! Steel city Pops is located in the Picnic Food truck Park located off of Barton Springs Road.We had spent all day at Barton Springs pool and the ice pops were the refreshing treat we needed. I ordered the champagne white tea, It was so delicious and fresh. It wasn't too sweet and it even had bits of white tea in it. I was so impressed with the flavors, so amazing. My BF ordered the strawberry lemonade, it was like taking a step back to my child hood and having pink lemonade after a day at the pool on a hot summer's day, but as a grown up, to was so refreshing and I could taste the strawberry and lemonade. Definitely give it a try, it's delicious!"
1140,7/23/2016,Lauren W.,austin,5,"These pops are really good! I've tried some in Dallas before and the flavor I tried today was really good too. I've only had the creamy ones so I can't speak for the fruity ones. I really like how they post the ingredients and nutrition information online so you know what you're eating and it's great if you're looking for a healthy sweet treat. some of the pops are not too bad of a sweet indulgence and they use simple ingredients! My friend has never tried these but really liked it. We had coconut and horchata. I believe they change the menu from time to time at this location. I posted the most recent menu. A tip is if you want to take a picture of it, do it fast because it melts super fast! Grab a lot of napkins with you too because you'll need it! I like how there are seating area there for people to enjoy and there are other food trucks there you can buy from!"
1141,9/27/2016,Jeanne Y.,austin,3,"I love Steel City Pops and I was excited to know that it came to Austin.Once I arrived, I was immediately disappointed. The stand only offered four different flavors and none of them were flavors that I particularly liked. I've been to the Dallas location multiple times and the selection there is far more extensive. Hopefully, Austin will soon make a brick and mortar for Steel City Pops!"
1142,7/17/2016,Lisa H.,austin,4,I thought it is a food truck or a shop but actually a small cute cart haha. Fruity icecreams are great! Avocado tastes like yogurt.
1143,7/9/2016,Nicole S.,austin,5,"BEST POPS!! I first went to Steel City in Dallas and loved it, so I was delighted to hear they are now in Austin! Great location near Barton Springs and Zilker Park, and great for hot Austin summers. I personally like the creamy pops (especially coconut and peach cream), but the fruity pops are very refreshing as well! At $3/each, the prices are very reasonable for a delicious treat! I will definitely be back!"
1144,11/10/2016,Mays K.,austin,1,I hate places that do not have the respect for their customers to be available by the phone number they provide or to open according to their hours. Unreachable by phone and not here during business hours. Don't bother opening a business if this is how little you care.
1145,6/24/2016,Erin K.,austin,5,"This is the child branch of the larger Steel City Pops that can be found in Dallas. It doesn't have as many flavors as the larger brick and mortar one, but this is a cute popsicle stand that has wonderfully sweet and fruity flavors that will help beat this crappy Texas heat. Had the peach cream here, which is very tasty and has real peach chunks. It's pretty creamy, and tastes like your basic delicious peaches and cream, but less artificial, haha. Also tried the champagne white tea, which I think is so far my favorite non dairy (fruity flavors). The girl at the register (?)is really sweet and friendly and is very knowledgeable about the flavors."
1146,7/1/2016,Lynn A.,austin,5,"FINALLY!!! Steel City has come to Austin! You gotta try this place. My daughter introduced meto them in Fort Worth. Granted, I was not a fan of popsicles previous to this experience. These are no ordinary pops. The coconut, coffee and passion fruit are our families favorite, so dense with flavor and all natural it's addictive. These are gourmet and worth every penny. When this place finally gets discovered there will be a line out the door just like in Fort Worth. I guarantee it. Yum."
1147,7/4/2016,Brittney F.,austin,5,Awesome! After biking and swimming all day we stopped here for an ice cream. The peaches and cream is my favorite and amazing. Definitely check this place out!! Yum! We will be back.
1148,7/15/2016,Natasha P.,austin,5,"Amazing! Best popsicles ever. My favorites so far: caramel, avocado lime, and buttermilk (sounds odd, but it's like a vanilla cheesecake flavor). Excellent location, and someone is there for lunch and dinner hours. Super friendly staff."
1149,9/30/2017,Christine Y.,austin-2,5,"Fruit pops, creamy pops, chocolate-covered pops...it's popsicle madness at Steel City Pops. There are so many different kinds of flavors to choose from. I like to get a new flavor each time. For $1.25, you can add toppings (yes, plural!) to your pop. It's like a power up. It's delicious and worth the extra $$$. I find that adding toppings makes the pop richer...and it's plenty of pop to share with a friend if you can't commit to an entire one on your own.It's college-kid friendly, family friendly, date night friendly. Good for groups...and even good as a to-go option (they have cute little mini ""coolers"" if you order a dozen or more to go)!Welcome to Austin (finally!), Steel City Pops!"
1150,9/25/2017,Pin C.,austin-2,5,This pop of the month was yummy.  Got the pop of the month.Service great.  They were really welcoming and nice
1151,9/16/2017,Azaria L.,austin-2,4,"So I got the peach cream popsicle And my roommate got the strawberry cream popsicle! It really delicious! The process goes like this1. You choose a popsicle from either the fruity, creamy, or cookie popsicle section. 2. Choose if you want your popsicle to be dipped in white, dark, or milk chocolates and also another flavored dip.3. You can also add drizzle, and dust I would say if you're there just for the popsicle itself then I don't think it's worth it"
1152,9/12/2017,Troy H.,austin-2,4,"Great place. Clean all around. Helpful Staff to assist in your selections.We decided to drive from Round Rock to here for a unique Sunday treat and we were not displeased. The flavors are a great combination to meet many finicky taste-buds and then the options after that are almost endless for what you want.  I enjoyed the sweet and spice of Pineapple Jalapeno dusted with cayenne. The Jalapeno was not prevalent in the pop, but you could taste the smokey/earthy flavor in most bites. The pineapple flavor was distinct and fresh... NOT too sugary. I added the cayenne and it was a great spice that hit my lips, tongue, and palate right in the front, but was eventually cooled by the pineapple pop itself.  Overall a great for you and great tasting pop."
1153,9/9/2017,Amanda W.,austin-2,5,"Tried steel city pops for the first time today and need to go back to try it again! I got the lavendar lemonade popsicle and my boyfriend got the blood orange one. I'm an avid fan of fruit popsicles so i was ecstatic when steel city pops opened the brick and mortor. At 3.50 a popsicle it's not really the cheapest, but considering a cup of icecream is usually 5 dollars, it was a good deal. Customizing it with more stuff is a 1$ extra.It's customizable icecream and you can choose to dip, drizzle or dredge your popsicle with toppings. I opted for a caramel drizzle on mine. I wanted to try the peach or pineapple one but i chose the lavendar one because it was recommended by the worker. Taste was good. My popsicle was a miss for me. The main thing was my lavendar pop was extremely sweet and the lavendar was very very strong, i think i should have tried the peach one instead. The caramel was really tasty and had a nice saltiness to it. The blood orange one was super good and tasted very light and refreshing.Overall, i will be back to try other flavors!"
1154,9/13/2017,Errol M.,austin-2,4,"Yelp can be a nasty place, you know it, I know it, and I was totally ready to snark Steel City Pops: Did they seriously just take a paleta and go all hipster on it? Austin is still Texas, you know. And then of course, the bright & effervescent staff here killed me with kindness. And I never have to reference Ms Gomez again. So a couple of things, I just didn't feel like writing an essay today:1. This place was that dry cleaners on the Drag, right? Eight parking spots and Ceviche 7 next door.2. If you're not familiar with genuine paletas, don't confuse ""pops"" here with those sugar water ""popsicle"" sticks we lickety-licked growing up. 3. If you're here doing a pop, go nuts with that one time extra $1.25 fee to dip, dredge, & dust your pop with all sorts of stuff. Like nuts. It's kind of like being at the latest poké place.4. Their YouTube channel has interesting ""Pop of the month"" videos, which I don't think are mentioned in the stores. So I had them make me one I saw, the ""Peach Cobbler"" - peach cream pop, white chocolate dip, graham cracker dredge. At $5.13, it was pretty darn good.  5. There's no tip jar in sight. They donate your change, if you want.6. Steel City Pops is one of those companies without a Wikipedia listing. I always find that intriguing. 7. And I'm mildly curious why a company based in Alabama opens a dozen stores throughout Texas, pretty much all at once. Does it really matter? Nah. Is it another fun way to vent your disposable income? You bet."
1155,9/18/2017,Alice L.,austin-2,4,"Definitely a cool experience, worth trying out. There are endless combinations you can do with your popsicle, from dips and drizzles to a wide range of toppings. Had the coconut popsicle with chocolate and pecans and the cheesecake popsicle with chocolate and salted caramel. The popsicles tasted good, but I still think they're quite pricey being over $5 for each... especially with only a small spoonful of toppings for $1. But I might be back to try other flavors, as cold treats are always a necessity in Texas heat."
1156,9/7/2017,Alyssa N.,austin-2,5,"Super great addition to the shops on Guad. I came here for the soft opening and they were letting people take as many pops as they desired. I think they eventually started limiting the amount, but either way, WAT?! My roommates had wanted to come but weren't able to make it, so I took a few extra for them and then bolted back home to put them in my freezer. Definitely the most generous soft opening I've ever been to. And also effective! I am looking forward to going back. As for the pops, can't really go wrong here (I think)! Very yummy and as refreshing as can be. I like how they have different types of pops (fruity, creamy, etc). I tried the strawberry lemonade and had a bit of the strawberry cream and both were very satisfying. Also, props to whoever designed their shop and menu. Everything is so cute and aesthetic -- I am certain they will be featured in many social media pics from here on."
1157,10/2/2017,Susan L.,austin-2,4,"WOW! I mean, I'd rather have free water, but besides that it's AMAZING AND FANTASTIC!"
1158,9/22/2017,Claudia C.,austin-2,5,They had a steel city pops in my hometown (shout out to Fort Worth!!!) so I already knew it was gonna be good. I love their flavors! They always have something interesting and different like toasted marshmallow or champagne white tea. Sometimes the flavors sound intimidating but the flavors always work. I'm a huge fan!
1159,9/6/2017,Jillian L.,austin-2,4,"We drove by Steel City Pops and knew we had to give it a try. This location has a modern, industrial feel. They have windows everywhere - leading outside and into the kitchen. They offer both fruity and creamy pops in various unique flavors. You can also customize them with dips, drizzles, and toppings for $1.25. My friend and I ordered the pineapple jalapeño and lavender lemonade. Both were very tasty and refreshing. The pops are also larger than your average store bought popsicle and made with organic and locally sourced ingredients. All in all, not a bad way to beat the Texas heat!"
1160,9/7/2017,Khang H.,austin-2,4,"Good tasting pops. I like how they display the calories in each pop. Had the cucumber lime, no extra toppings, it's good but too sweet for me, i wasn't able to finish it but it's definitely worth a try. 8 parking spots as well a street parking."
1161,9/18/2017,Danna T.,austin-2,5,Great service and delicious popsicles as always! Lots of space and seating both indoors and out. I love that they opened a location so close to campus and West Campus! I'll definitely be back for more.
1162,9/23/2017,Jaime P.,austin-2,5,A great cool snack on a hot afternoon.  So many choices and everything sounded good. I got a vanilla chocolate chip pop covered in milk chocolate and dredged in chocolate crumbs.  Definitely worth checking out.
1163,9/23/2017,Mimi F.,austin-2,3,"3 stars as the staff was friendly and they have an outdoor area which was nice to sit at while we ate. -2 stars because the buttermilk pop I had tasted truly sour (there is sour creme in it but it tasted off). I didn't finish my pop and neither did my boyfriend as they just weren't that good. I liked the chocolate coating on the outside and the caramel drizzle but expected more of a delicious Popsicle from a place that specializes in exclusively Popsicles, yknow? I asked the couple next to us what they thought of their fruit based pops and they responded ""yeah, they're okay"". The couple seemed to like the ambiance more than the Popsicle itself, which I kind of felt the same about. Maybe I'll return, but I kinda doubt it..."
1164,9/12/2017,Blair M.,san-antonio,5,"I enjoyed this restaurant during the San Antonio FoodK.They had many flavors, and, they noted that their restaurant features over 20 different options. Due to the heat, I opted for something cool and refreshing. Their strawberry lemonade flavor did just the trick. It wasn't overly sweet; you could taste that it wasn't loaded with unhealthy sugar. I loved the taste, and, I can't wait to try more flavors!"
1165,9/29/2017,Dean H.,san-antonio,3,"I really want to give this place more stars but I can't just yet.  I'll start with the good:(1) fun location;(2) amazing vibe and facilities;(3) the ice cream-based popsicles are a solid 4 stars.What I couldn't get over (especially in a paleta heavy city like SA) is the texture of the water-based popsicles. They were just too grainy for my liking and I found the flavors overly strong.  I am going to go back with hopes of trying more items and upping my score, but right now this is, for me at least, a three star place."
1166,9/16/2017,Kayla P.,san-antonio,4,"Nice refreshing, light treat in SoFlo area. Can spruce up your pop with add-ons or keep it simple. There's room to play with your food. Indoor and outdoor seating. It's cheaper than Cold Stone and doesn't make you feel lethargic after. You can opt-in to collect stars (reward program) to get free pops.I ordered the lavender lemonade to keep my meal on the low calorie side (walked across the street after eating at Señor Veggie). It's a hot day and the lemonade hit the spot-just wish I saw the strawberry lemonade flavor before I ordered. I will definitely be back."
1167,9/6/2017,Diana G.,san-antonio,4,"Love the concept. You choose your pop and then top it to your hearts content. You can dip your popsicle in the chocolate of your choice or just top it with nuts  I decided on the buttermilk pop dipped in dark chocolate with pecans and sea salt. I opted out of looking at the calorie content of my delicious dessert, but for those interested, it is posted next to each pop.I definitely recommend you cool down with one of these delicious pops on a hot San Antonio day."
1168,9/5/2017,Devyn P.,san-antonio,5,"Omg. Best ""popsicle"" I've ever had!! These were delivered to us at work, so the choices were very limited. I chose the Blood Orange Popsicle which was so full of flavor. I didn't expect much, as popsicles are usually not something I'm craving. However, this company totally changed my mind! This pop was out of this world good! I'd like to return and try more flavors- maybe something with chocolate :) I also cannot comment on the price or the service, as I have not experienced that yet. 5 stars for delicious, juicy, mouth-watering flavor!!!"
1169,7/19/2017,Madeline R.,san-antonio,5,"Had the opportunity recently to finally check out Steel City Pops. The location is perfect in Southtown.I went with my kiddos and we ordered an assortment of paletas. Everybody was so friendly.We ordered the coconut paletas dipped in dark chocolate , milk chocolate and dust with pistachios and pecans. Also we ordered cookies and creme and vanilla bean. They were excellent! I'm not an ice cream person and they were really good for this Texas weather!The paletas are made with natural ingredients which is a must for me!The offer one free paleta for military.I'll be going back!!"
1170,7/16/2017,Stephanie P.,san-antonio,4,"Props to the marketing team for Steel City Pops!!! Entertaining again this weekend, my friend and I were on the hunt for popsicles to beat the heat and eat tasty treats. We found SCP through Yelp and headed down to Southtown to experience it ourselves. The cute and colorful mural helps you find the shop. Loved that there was parking included and I didn't have to parallel park. Thumbs up for the little things. The front of the shop was inviting, well decorated, and on trend. When we walked in the aromas were drool inducing. We were invited to dip, drizzle, and dine to our hearts content with fruit flavored or creamy popsicles. You choose your flavor, can decide if you want anything additional, and then you receive your treat! It was a little pricey, about $4 a pop (pun intended), but definitely worth it every once in a while to treat yourself.The pops made our day. Delicious, refreshing, and not too heavy. Great for TX heat. I will be going back at some point and when I do I'll have to remember the loyalty program. Every 10 pops you buy you get 1 free! Looking forward to trip #11."
1171,7/7/2017,Pinkey P.,san-antonio,5,"As an avid visitor of Steel City when I lived in Dallas, I was so excited when I heard they opened one in downtown San Antonio! When I first saw the location, I was unsure if it would be a good place for parking and spacious enough, but I was pleasantly surprised with all the free parking available and spacious interior of the shop. I love this place for the variety of flavors they have and how they also switch out by season, so make sure to indulge while you can on the seasonal pops! I love the avocado, carrot cake,  coffee and the strawberry lemonade pops, they are easily my favorites. Be sure to inquire about creating a loyalty account with them, because every 10 pops you buy there is one free!also the staff at this location made sure to make us all feel welcomed and that everything tasted okay, very friendly! tip: if you ever get a popsicle and don't like it, they have a policy to swap it out for another one."
1172,7/15/2017,Tandy G.,san-antonio,5,"O.M.GYou want to die and go to paleta heaven? Don't. Just go to Steel City Pops. This place is the bomb. Some say legit. I agree. Too legit to quit.You pick your flavor pop, dip it in your choice of chocolate, drizzle it in your favorite sauce, dredge it in your favorite nut, dust it in your favorite spice! You cannot go wrong, even if you just choose the pop.I had chocolate chili, dipped in white chocolate, dredged in pistachio, drizzled in caramel and dusted in sea salt. My mouth melted with deliciousness."

Updated review",Anastasia H.,san-antonio,5,"first time was so good, we just had to return and bring a friend- or 3. We came to SCP to introduce the nephews plus a girlyfriend to the awesomeness. I tried the coconut flavor and splurged on the chocolate drizzle: what I learned is that as much fun as the drizzle is, the coconut pop flavor stands out all on its own and does not need any kind of accent. The flavor was consistent and I loved the toasted coconut cluster at the bottom of the pop. Hubs tried the avocado and drizzled it with chocolate as well ( dont knock it til you try it): he loved it! The nephews were huge fans as well. be warned, if you brought home a menu from your last trip to the pop shop - you can not expect the same pops the next time you go. One of my nephews were looking forward to the blueberry basil and they had another amazing pop in its place. no worries, just a heads up."
1174,7/13/2017,Rody A.,san-antonio,5,"It's really hard to describe this place as another other than extraordinary. Everything on the menu looks extremely delicious and It's almost a bit overwhelming but the staff does an incredible job explaining and walking you through the process step by step.I decided to order one of their cookie popsicles which include an actual cookie inside of popsicle. It was one of the best dessert experiences of my life. I ordered the cookies and cream popsicle with a white chocolate dip, drizzled with sea salt! It was perfect. If you're in the area just stop by you'll love it."
1175,8/15/2017,Linda H.,san-antonio,5,"My friend has been ranting and raving about this place for the longest time and I was hesitant on going.  I WAS a dedicated Paleteria customer...but the one Friday night that we decided to go to Paleteria, they were closed.  We had our little nephew in town and had promised him ice cream/popsicle of some sort.  So, we rode our bike towards Southtown and saw Steel City Pop and decided to stop by.I rode up to the front of the shop and I couldn't believe the crowd that was there at 9 PM on a Friday night.  So, we parked our bikes and got in line.  I started looking at the menu and realized that the options are endless!!! Oh, BTW, they include calorie count on each item JUST in case you were trying to be good  :)I got to the front and had decided on a non-creamy based pop but was then told that this month's flavor was the Mexican Hot Chocolate.  Uh..you think I'm going to pass that up? So, that's what I ordered.  My hubby and nephew got the strawberry lemonade and the BIL got the strawberry cream dipped in chocolate and drizzled with white chocolate.  Say WHAT? The Mexican hot chocolate was great, the strawberry lemonade was good, but HOLY CRAP! The Strawberry cream dipped in chocolate and drizzled with white chocolate? That's the way to go, my friends! So..with that being said..I'll be back for sure to enjoy the yumminess! My only gripe is that I wish they had more tables outside so people can sit.  People were sitting on the ground and anything else that they could possibly find.  But..with this type of options, flavor, and freshness...it's worth it!"
1176,8/22/2017,Ellen E.,san-antonio,5,"This place is so cool! (See what I did there?) was having lunch with a friend across the street and decided we needed to POP over here for dessert. First you pick your pop- flavors are categorized by ""fruity"" ""creamy"" or ""cookies"". From there, you can choose to dip it in your choice of chocolate, dredge it with toppings, drizzle with more chocolate, and add a dash of seasoning such as sea salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. this place is like a Popsicle version of subway with fresh ingredients. Get your Popsicle anyway you want. They were also making popsicles when we were there, so that was cool to watch for a while. I didn't want to go too crazy my first visit here, so I got a coconut Popsicle (creamy category), and drizzled dark chocolate. It was delicious! We ordered two popsicles for $7. The price is right, and the location is great."
1177,8/17/2017,Dream-Suphada L.,san-antonio,4,"Such a fun place and you can beat a good popsicle for this summer heat! Love how you can customize the dips, toppings and drizzles to your liking!"
1178,7/31/2017,Mary S.,san-antonio,5,"Best place to visit especially on a hot summer day. There is plenty of parking in their lot or on the street. Lots of fruity and creamy options! I had the coffee dipped in dark chocolate,drizzled with white chocolate, and dusted with cinnamon. My pop was amazing! Don't forget to take pictures with the signs before you leave. Have fun!! Great customer service and an easily affordable treat."
1179,7/22/2017,Arianne Victoria A.,san-antonio,4,"Popsicle game here is 100.  Here I fell in love with the cucumber lime popsicle dipped in white chocolate and topped with toasted coconut. Choose uniquely flavored popsicles, whether you want it fruity or creamy. Then you have it dipped, drizzled, and topped with items of your choice! It's in the south town area and you don't have to worry about parking because they have their own big lot. A great fancy popsicle place to try for summer."
1180,7/20/2017,Bryan B.,san-antonio,4,"Neat-oh little pop shop! Loved the building, and the weather was crazy hot. These pops are cold; and they have so many flavors. I tried an avocado, passion fruit, and vanilla bean. All delicious, good toppings and drizzles. The combinations cease to end. Only thing is, that it's so dang far if you live on the outskirts."
1181,8/2/2017,Debbie D.,san-antonio,5,"Super cool place to POP into! You can pick a pop and then you get to customize it. You can get it dipped and then you can add nuts or other toppings. FYI you have to get your pop dipped for you to add nuts, coconut flakes, etc, otherwise it doesn't have anything to stick to. They have creamy pops and fruit based pops. I got a passion fruit one and felt like it was really hard compared to the creamy ones.  All in all it was cool checking this place out and my pop came out super good. Recommend this place for sure!"
1182,8/21/2017,Michaela M.,san-antonio,4,"Came to see what the hype was all about and Steel City Pops did not disappoint! I am not a huge fan of sweets, but these popsicles were YUMMY! I ordered the lavender lemonade, my boyfriend ordered the coffee, and his mom ordered the pineapple jalapeño. We were all impressed with these wonderful flavors especially with this hot Texas weather. I also appreciate that they have dairy free options available. The only negative thing I have to say was that the location is very far away from where I live and it took us a long time to find parking. So in order to enjoy these pops we really had to go out of the way to get there! I hope they expand and make more locations around San Antonio soon!"
1183,9/12/2017,Celeste B.,san-antonio,5,"I feel like a kid again every time I walk into Steel City Pops. The cute ambience, the friendly employees, and most importantly...PALETAS!! The combinations between flavors, drizzles, dips, and toppings are really endless. This is a cute date spot or a great spot to catch up on chisme with your besties."
1184,7/13/2017,Amanda S.,san-antonio,5,"This place is AMAZING. I went on a Thursday evening expecting it to be busy but the lines weren't long at all. Upon entering you're greeted and they show you a menu explaining all their flavors. All their popsicles are made fresh in store and you can actually see the staff making them while you sit and eat.I ended up choosing the pineapple jalapeño popsicle with a milk chocolate dip and a dust of sea salt on top! Sounds like a weird combo, right!?? But it was so good and my taste buds are thanking me!I will be returning! Go check it out!"
1185,8/6/2017,Jo M.,san-antonio,5,"Where the traditional Mexican paleta goes gourmet. Aye que fancy. ^Tip:  The water based paletas taste best plain. The cream based taste good:  Dipped. Dredged. Drizzled. Dusted. We loved the coconut dipped in white chocolate, and dredged in toasted coconut and pistachio. The blood orange is delicious served plain. The cucumber lime is like Woodlawn Lake on a stick; just add chili powder. The lavender lemonade was also very good if your mind can get passed that it tastes like lavender smells. It left me intrigued because it did not smell like lavender.  I love science."
1186,8/15/2017,Kdizzle W.,san-antonio,5,"Clean, efficient, and kind staff. We enjoyed watching them make the strawberry/lemonade pops. A little pricey. pineapple jalapeño w/ chocolate drizzle and a dust of cayenne pepper. If you want them to go, bring a cooler. The Togo bag, only keeps them cool for a short amount of time in this Texas heat."
1187,9/6/2017,Katie D.,san-antonio,5,"This place was recommended to me... Get the cookies and cream she said. So I did and BOY was it delicious! I ordered it dipped in white chocolate sprinkled with pecans. It literally tasted like milk and cookies, definitely an addiction, I've already visited twice, having ordered the same pop, next time I will try something different:) I also love a place with a rewards card!"
1188,8/10/2017,Stephanie S.,san-antonio,5,"This place was kinda amazing! I loved that I chose the pop and toppings. They had such a great variety! The service was pleasant and the shop felt cozy. I also enjoyed watching one of the workers package the pops! Steel City Pops is a foodie must have!!!Stephanie,LREA (830)212-1137Apartment Locator"
1189,7/27/2017,Omar T.,san-antonio,5,"Had the Peanut Butter Pie dipped in Dark Chocolate! Perfect dessert after eating at the Rivercenter Potbelly after a long, hot day at SplashTown.I highly recommend this place. Ice pops so good, they'll make you wanna slap yourself silly for not coming there sooner!"
1190,9/18/2017,Sarah G.,san-antonio,5,"Went here with the familia after enjoying some pizza right down the way!(southtown pizzeria) It was a Monday night about 9pm so there was no wait and we went right up to the counter to order.I was a little overwhelmed by all the choices! Fruity, creamy, and cookie based flavors, but went with the cucumber lime. I was afraid it was going to be to cucumbery and and a watery type of flavor but I was completely wrong! It was the perfect mix of both.I chose to dip mine in white chocolate, drizzle with milk chocolate and added some graham cracker crumbs! Sounds odd, chocolate and lime but it was so good! Don't knock it till you try it! :) I was also pleasantly surprised by how thick the pops are.These are not the store bought puny pops I grew up with. Also side note:my dad was wearing a military hat and the cashier noticed and said his pop was free and thanked him for his service!THAT MADE HIS NIGHT!! AWESOME service and you have earned lifetime customers. Join the rewards program too 10 pops get one free!"
1191,9/10/2017,Verónica M.,san-antonio,5,Í have the coconut ice pop dipped on Milk chocolate drizzled with caramel  and powered with pistachios
1192,8/5/2017,Tee P.,san-antonio,3,"Overhyped place to get popsicles...I mean I guess I'm just basic since I only tried their watermelon popsicle lol but I guess on a hot summer day it's nice to get a frozen treat..parking is ok but can get crowded and is limited.  The place is small, barely enough seats once the place is crowded the line goes out the door. I guess it's something to try..."
1193,7/31/2017,Katy S.,san-antonio,5,"I love Paletas, so I was very excited to try this new popsicle place! I got a coconut pop dipped in dark chocolate and sprinkled with toasted coconut for $5. It was amazingly delicious and reasonably priced ice cream in a part of time where ice cream can get pretty pricey. It is a new a different experience, If you like popsicles then I would highly recommend you try one here!"
1194,8/19/2017,Shawnda B.,san-antonio,5,Such an adorable concept and cute atmosphere.  The peach pop was DELICIOUS!!! My hubs got the works and loved it.   We will be going back soon.
1195,8/22/2017,Valerie V.,san-antonio,5,"Great addition to the 210. Friendly staff and fast service. Strawberry lemonade is perfect for a hot summer day and oatmeal cream pie was different, but delicious!"
1196,9/16/2017,Raul Q.,san-antonio,5,Cute little place in one of our favorite neighborhoods the Pops were delish and full flavored a little pricey but worth the expense . The thing i love the most is my girls get excited about this place so its a thrill for me ! I highly recommend for a family night out
1197,7/31/2017,Holly L.,san-antonio,5,"Great concept and something for everyone regardless of most dietary restrictions! Creative flavors and fresh, fresh, fresh!!! I had an Avocado Lime pop dipped in dark chocolate, dusted with sea salt and cinnamon. I loved it!!!"
1198,7/30/2017,Diane T.,san-antonio,5,These were delicious! I got the strawberry! I had it dipped in dark chocolate with sea salt. All the options looked amazing! I was impressed that they had the calories posted. That helps a lot when your on a diet. The staff was friendly. I just wish there was more seating.
1199,9/17/2017,Italia V.,san-antonio,5,Delicious!!  I had the cookies and cream pop dipped in milk chocolate sprinkled with graham crackers and drizzled in Carmel. It was absolutely amazing!
1200,6/30/2017,Charlsie G.,san-antonio,5,"Went for the first time today! I wanted to try it. I know it's just a popsicle, but they add so much more! Also, the cashier was totally helpful when I couldn't decide what I wanted. I ended up getting coconut, dipped in dark chocolate, and dusted with pistachios. It was lovely! I'll be returning with friends! It's the perfect treat for a hot summer day. Plenty of parking and seating as well."
1201,7/13/2017,Joya H.,san-antonio,4,"If you can't decide because everything sounds amazing...go with the coffee pop, dipped in milk chocolate, dredged in pistachios, drizzled in caramel, and dusted with sea salt! Yum! But seriously...I'm sure any decision you make will be good."
1202,7/6/2017,Jeanette R.,san-antonio,5,Delicious organic popsicles. Large variety of flavors.  You can also take them to go.
1203,8/10/2017,Candace N.,san-antonio,5,Got coconut pop dipped in dark chocolate with sea salt dust!! The chocolate and sea salt was the perfect combination. The coconut pop was so creamy. Perfect treat for a hot summer day
1204,7/12/2017,Catherine C.,san-antonio,4,"Decided to give this place a try and my daughter and I enjoyed it.  We walked in and the staff were talking and waiting for people to order.  We went up to the counter and I explained to the lady that it was our first time and she told us that we needed to pick a pop then we could decorate it.  We both chose our flavor, chocolate and root beer, and she proceeded to charge us.  When I told her that I wanted my pop dipped in chocolate she huffed and told me that I needed to tell her that before she charged us.  Well excuse me but I did just state that it was my first time so.....anyways after clearing that mess up we were given our pops.  I had a chocolate pop dipped in chocolate and dredged in toasted coconut and my daughter had a root beer dipped in chocolate and dredged in graham crackers.  Although I like the concept I don't think I'll be returning.  I prefer to go to Alamode gelato and panini."
1205,9/7/2017,Lauryn G.,san-antonio,5,"So many amazing and delicious flavors and options to choose from! Dip, dredge, dust, drizzle in any order you so choose. Always looking forward to another great flavor and experience here. We even drive 30 minutes across town just to get some of this pop goodness. First time I opted for a simple coconut dipped in milk chocolate. Second time I tried the avocado which has a nice fresh creamy lime flavor, dipped in milk chocolate, dredged with pistachio, drizzled with caramel and dusted with sea salt. So amazingly delicious. Can't wait for my next flavor experience here!"
1206,8/8/2017,Rosie B.,san-antonio,5,Stopped by with the family after a walk around  downtown. It was a very refreshing treat. I enjoyed the coffee paleta with caramel drizzle and espresso sprinkle. Hubby had the coconut paleta dipped in dark chocolate. My daughter ate the strawberry paleta dipped in chocolate. We will definitely stop by again. So many combinations to try. They even have an avocado paleta. I'll see if I'm brave enough to try it next time!
1207,8/17/2017,Kelly T.,san-antonio,4,"Great idea for ice cream. Love the design inside. They have many flavor to choose and topping. You can get so many creative from the menu. Staffs were nice and great. I had chocolate pop w pistachios on top. It was good, flavorful but too sweet. If they could make it less sweet. It would be awesome."
1208,6/30/2017,Nancy P.,san-antonio,5,"I tried the strawberry lemonade fruit pop. It was delicious, and the staff there was amazing."
1209,7/14/2017,Fabian M.,san-antonio,5,"Looking for a place to cool down and grab a quick snack, then this is your spot. For around $4/$5 you can get a paleta style popsicle with the option to have it dipped, drizzled or sprinkled with different flavors. I had the strawberry cream dipped in white chocolate and my son had the vanilla bean dipped in dark chocolate...."
1210,7/7/2017,Lynnette B.,san-antonio,5,Sweet and cold awesomeness great way to deal with this HEAT! Yay! Finally here in SA! We're glad you're here!
1211,8/12/2017,Maria N.,san-antonio,3,"Great service, efficient, clean, well trained personnel. Just feel pops from a chain are a bit overrated. Much rather have the local boozy gelato a block away or the one 1/2 mile away at the Blue Star. Those two are AWESOME and family owned."
1212,8/21/2017,Karen V.,san-antonio,5,Such a cute place!! The pops that I have tried to far are amazing! My favorite has been the coffee with chocolate drizzle and sprinkles of cinnamon! The mural is fun and picturesque.
1213,7/5/2017,Denisse R.,san-antonio,5,"We visited during 4th of July weekend... and we were not disappointed! My girls, my husband and I absolutely loved their popsicles! I had been following them in Instagram and wanted to make sure I visited during our trip, to our surprise, it was right down the street from where we stayed. I would definitely recommend!"
1214,8/27/2017,Megan M.,san-antonio,5,Very good pops!!! Service was great and the pops were delicious!! Has a cute yard out front for you to sit in and enjoy.
1215,8/19/2017,Steve S.,san-antonio,5,"Crazy good, drizzle, dip, dust, or dredge your popsicle. Fresh ingredients good taste lots of fun! We will definitely be back again and again."
1216,8/13/2017,Priscilla B.,san-antonio,5,I saw this place on Facebook!! It far exceeded my expectations!!!!! Great staff. So many combinations!! Will be back again and again!!!
1217,7/31/2017,Bree T.,san-antonio,4,Yum!! I had the cucumber lime dusted with cayenne & sea salt. Sooo good!! We need one of these in Phoenix!
1218,7/31/2017,Harmony C.,san-antonio,5,"The popsicles are delicious.  My favorite is the strawberries and cream, and the coffee.  The manager and staff are all so kind.  All the times i've gone in, I've always had great customer service.   Today I accidentally tried to go into the store before the shop opened, and the manager came out and gave me a free popsicle.  It made my day. Thank you!"
1219,7/3/2017,Klarissa R.,san-antonio,3,While the pops here are good there are plenty of local paleterias here in SA that need our business more
1220,7/23/2017,Diana C.,san-antonio,5,Amazing customer service. Pops were flavored extremely well and was worth the trip. kids picked great flavors and took some home for the boo
1221,9/11/2017,Brenda G.,san-antonio,2,"Pops are over priced but they are pretty tasty, the service was fast. However one employee I found very rude and unwelcoming as soon as we walked in. Unfortunately I didn't get her name but she was rude and loud for no reason and the rest of the employees looked at each other as if entertained by her behavior horrible experience."
1222,7/19/2017,Ashley M.,san-antonio,5,"I was visiting a friend in San Antonio recently when she took me to Steel City Pops. I am from Arizona so I had never heard of such a thing, but was excited to try it. Can I just say... WE NEED A STEEL CITY POPS IN PHOENIX. They have a large variety of popsicle choices, but what makes it is the assortment of toppings and dips (ie. milk chocolate, white chocolate, pistachios, sprinkles, etc.) I got the Lavender Lemon Popsicle drizzled with white chocolate and was not disappointed. WHEN I go back I want to try the Avocado Popsicle because... common, how strange but delicious does that sound!?"
1223,7/6/2017,Clarisse P.,san-antonio,3,"Decided to see what all the hype was about!! I ordered the avocado pop dipped in dark chocolate and pistachio. The staff was very friendly and the service was quick. Was super excited to try my popsicle, but upon first bite I was super confused about the flavor. It didn't taste like avocado at all, and I had my friend taste it to make sure my taste buds weren't off. She agreed that it didn't taste like avocado, so I assumed that the staff gave me the wrong flavor. It tastes like lime. I went up to the counter and they gladly made me another. When I took a bite out of it again, it was still the wrong flavor and the same flavor as before... didn't wanna bother going back up again because the line was getting long... super bummed that I didn't get to try the actual flavor I wanted to try. I ate around the popsicle instead. The chocolate and pistachio coating was quite good for the most part. Would still come back again, but I hope they won't mix up the flavors again next time"
1224,8/18/2017,Anna K.,san-antonio,5,Steel City Pops is a great new addition to Southtown. They have amazingly delicious flavors and a great atmosphere!
1225,7/14/2017,Casey G.,san-antonio,5,We came in on a Friday night to try this place out! The line was out the door but the service was very fast. They have so many flavors and toppings. It was hard to come up with a combo. They had some great recommendations and were super helpful. We will definitely be returning! Steel city pops is a place you must try!!
1226,8/28/2017,Dip D.,san-antonio,5,"Loved it, awesome place for a really fun treat during a hot day.  I had the creamy pop and though it was a bit pricey for a popsicle stick I think it was totally worth it!"
1227,8/2/2017,Matthew M.,san-antonio,2,"Patio is small and the pops are overpriced. However, the concept is cute and I'm sure many don't mind spending 5$ for the hype."
1228,8/7/2017,Kaylah E.,san-antonio,1,"I first went here and loved it, I spoke so good about this place & how the people who work there were so nice second time I went with my family to show them how great it was and I was completely embarrassed by the girl who was taking our order! She so rude and did not want to explain the flavors or even acted like she wanted to help us! So disappointed!"
1229,7/30/2017,Stephanie R.,san-antonio,5,This place is so neat!! Loved the options and ability to create our own pops. Friendly service. They gave a free pop for military with our order which we appreciated very much!! Will be back!!
1230,7/8/2017,Julie F.,san-antonio,5,"Great concept, location choice and product! Saw a friend post pics of this place and had to try it. Went there after a lovely early Saturday evening dinner at Feast in Southtown. It's a little tricky to find if you go by street address (in the 800 block of S Alamo but doesn't face the street; go around the back. Signage would really help -- hint, hint). It was worth the search. Since we were full from a yummy dinner, we opted for the lighter fruity fare and they did not disappoint. We sampled the watermelon, strawberry lemonade and blood orange. All were nicely sweet, good composition, perfect on a hot summer night. We will be back to try the dipped, drenched and sprinkled-on flavors. I am dying to sample the one with the brownie in the middle. The line moves fast since the popsicles are pre-made. The only prep required is if you embellish the pop. Loyalty program already snagged me 3 points toward 10 for a free something or other."
1231,7/18/2017,1 2.,san-antonio,5,"This place has great paletas! We tried chocolate brownie, strawberry lemonade and strawberry cream with white chocolate drizzle. I love that they have a drip cup for kids that u can purchase, it's 5 dollars but you can take home and it's amazing. I have a toddler and he loves to get his own paleta. This allowed me to enjoy my own treat while he ate his at his own pace and not get dirty or sticky! I also liked that u can see them making the paletas, very cool.  It's clean and the parking lot is pretty big. The staff there is very polite and helpful! I appreciate their patience while we thought about what paleta we wanted. Great place!"
1232,9/24/2017,Jessica C.,houston,5,"Tasty fruit pops! They change out their flavors frequently. The signs to line up is a bit confusing because they have 2 arrows on either sides pointing opposite directions.They also have creamy pops and create your own, where you can add dips and toppings. Not my cup of tea but I see a lot of people ordering it."
1233,8/19/2017,Pristine C.,houston,5,"Love this place! I was so pleasantly surprised to see how easy and spacious the parking lot was. The interior is so rustic chic and clean. The employees were nice and helpful. It was my first time & looking at all the options for dipping, dredging, etc was a little overwhelming in what to pick. My cashier helped me out a bunch and made it super easy. The transaction on their device was easy & entering my number to join the rewards program is a nice touch.  (1pt for every pop, 10 points = free pop) After inputting your #, it will text you with a link. By putting in your email, you'll get 3 additional points. I had the buttermilk popsicle and it was amazing! The cashier told me when trying to decide it tasted like cheesecake, so that's why I ordered it. It definitely did! She also informed me that if I didn't like it, I could swap it out for something else. While we were sitting down enjoying our pops, I loved seeing the flow of traffic come in and out of here. Definitely a great snack to munch on if you're wanting something sweet and you're in and out in no time.  I am definitely coming back!"
1234,8/19/2017,Kho I.,houston,4,"I never thought that I'd pay $4 for a popsicle and say ""this was good, can't wait to come back and try al the flavors"" but that's exactly what I said after trying this place. Really tasty and make everything from scratch including the fruit popsicle - none are made from juice. I bought two popsicles - a pomegranate (gotta be true to my roots) and a strawberry cream dipped in chocolate ( duh, of course ). Both were really good. I am literally back in line for a third!"
1235,9/25/2017,Debs C.,houston,3,Recently discovered that they can dip your popsicles in chocolate and have been doing every time I visit now. Honestly their cream based popsicles don't compare to Pop Fancy or even grocery store Haagen daz ones. The chocolate popsicle even leaves a waxy aftertaste but I still order it. My go to is the chocolate popsicle dipped in dark chocolate with graham crumbles. Cute place for a quick dessert though.
1236,8/4/2017,Anh L.,houston,3,"I finally got to try this place that everyone raves about. I was so excited. It was a hot day outside and going through the doors was a huge cool down. This place was easy to find and there are plenty of parking spots.BLUEBERRY BASILThis popsicle tasted like frozen blueberries. I couldn't taste the basil. I was hoping for something refreshing and light, but what I got was the taste of freezer fruit. It was sweet, but nothing special. I was expecting more.WATERMELONThe bf got this and I liked it. The watermelon was light and very refreshing. It wasn't overly sweet. It was just perfect. I would get this next time.I wouldn't mind coming back and trying other popsicle flavors. Not bad."
1237,8/6/2017,Bich V.,houston,3,"Been hearing about this place and seeing pictures everywhere, so when you're right next door to the place, why not try it out?! It was a Saturday evening, summer time but not too hot thanks to the cool breeze. Walked on over, there was a bit of a line inside but it was moving relatively quickly. That gave me time to look over the menu to see what to try. Since it was my first time there and I'm a huge cocoa lover, what else would I order but the chocolate pop :). I decided to get some espresso dust on it for kicks and giggles. We ordered 4 pops which gives you $1 off. What I really liked about the pop was that it stayed solid for quite a long time instead of melting all over your hands leaving you looking like a sticky mess. When you get dust or dip (into I don't remember all the choices), they give you this little paper ice cream holder thing. The consistency is also really nice as it's so creamy and thick.What I didn't like about the pop is the actual flavor, nothing too exciting about it. Definitely overhyped, but perhaps some of the fruity flavors will offer an explosion of fun... so I would maybe return to try it, not any time soon. I don't think the pops are worth $3 heh. What I love about Steel City Pops in general is the aesthetic of the place. It looks so cute and welcoming! It's mostly windows, and where there is brick (or whatever building material) it's painted white with some pinks in the cut out of the brick. Inside, the lights are the old school style that hang a bit low tying the whole place together. They have a decent amount of sitting area and they even made room for a ping pong table."
1238,8/15/2017,Bobby K.,houston,4,"Came in on a hot Sunday afternoon with some friends.Food: I got their cream base pop with matcha.  You know when you buy store bought popsicles, you can tell it's cheap by the taste and consistency.  Also you can tell with the frost bite and if the piece is frozen stiff.  The popsicle I got on the other hand was not like that. Consistency is pretty creamy and the best part is, it doesn't melt right away.  When I bite into it, I taste more of the cream base than the actually ice part  itself. That's how you know it's good quality ice cream!  The way it breaks when you bite into it, shows these break lines that are even in the popsicle.  Unlike those cheap popsicles that turn to mush when you bite into it.  I was very impressed!Overall: They had a separate room where you can sit by the tables, benches, and they have a ping pong table where you can play and eat your ice cream at the same time.  But I must warn you that it could be really challenging.  My only downside was the popsicle is worth 3 bucks, but I definitely got what I paid for."
1239,8/7/2017,Farran M.,houston,3,"I don't love Steel City Pops the way most people do, but I appreciate the atmosphere and concept. I was first introduced to SCP in Dallas and was thrilled to discover one was opening in Houston. It's a very cute place to take guests visiting from out of town.Perhaps I have not found my flavor in regards to the popsicles themselves, but I haven't tried one I disliked if that's any consolation.  What I like most about the Houston location in comparison to Dallas is the size. The sitting area is so spacious and the ping pong table is a nice touch. If you're in the area or just curious to see what the hype is all about, I'd recommend it. However, it's not my first, second or third choice when choosing a dessert or sweet snack."
1240,6/10/2017,Vicky N.,houston,5,"Best service I've experienced at any steel city pops location. Pops are always awesome, but when the staff saw I had my camera with me, they took extra caution to make sure the drizzle looked perfect on the pop. They didn't even know if I was going to take a photo or not, but they still were attentive and cautious.Awesome service, great people, always tasty product. 10/10 would recommend :)"
1241,8/17/2017,Elisa M.,houston,4,So many options to choose from! The popsicles were very natural and didn't melt as fast even in this hot Houston weather. Will have to come back to try more flavors.
1242,8/19/2017,Carolyn S.,houston,5,"What a deliciously, cute little store front. Our small bicycling group came by as a mid point  stop and it was a perfect way to rehydrate and put something sweet and natural in our bellies. The highest rated pops were the Strawberry Lemonade, Lavender Lemonade and Coffee. We were not bias and agreed we will definitely be using this shop as a stop again!"
1243,8/6/2017,Dhea P.,houston,4,"I've been here a few times--once in the hot Texan winter and once in the hotter Texan summer. The flavors were fairly unique and accurate to their name. Some were too sweet for my preference, however thoroughly enjoyed by my friends with a sweeter tooth. I think it's a fun place to try out, but a little expensive for a popsicle. Nonetheless, I'm sure I'll be back!"
1244,5/17/2017,Cara C.,houston,5,"Yum! Hard to go wrong with fresh popsicles on a warm Houston day (which is most days)... I prefer the fruit pops over the creamy pops, but they are all delicious. The flavors rotate regularly, so if you see one that intrigues you, get it while you're there. There is a cool dog-friendly ""indoor patio"" area with ping-pong tables and high top tables where you can hang out and socialize awhile. There are also benches out front if you prefer to actually be outdoors. It's a short walk or bike ride from the busier part of 20th & 19th Streets and there is usually plenty of parking, although it gets pretty packed on weekend afternoons."
1245,8/6/2017,Eman A.,houston,4,"** RATED 4.5 *** Who doesn't love some ice cream right? I got a vanilla pop dipped in milk chocolate with pistachios, caramel drizzle & sea salt! I wasn't disappointed one bit - delicious. The reason why I'm not giving this cute spot 5 stars is because it took me and my friends awhile to decide what we wanted and the employees were no help at all! So ya that was making the experience kinda lengthy."
1246,3/3/2017,Andrew N.,houston,5,"Steel City Pops is a cool and simple concept with a very clean design. They have a wide range of flavors from fruity to ice-creamesque. The prices are very reasonable at ~$3-5 per popsicle. It's a great place to take your family (kid friendly). There is an adjacent dining/game area next to the ordering counter. They have a ping pong table and picture props.All in all, a good dessert option that is different from  your typical dessert spot in Houston."

Updated review",Leslie T.,houston,5,"I still think this is a fantastic little place to end a day of shopping in the Heights, take the kids on a day off or steal away for a little self indulgence when you just need to disappear for some me time in the middle of the day in the middle of the week!Vanilla bean still my favorite. I like the creamier pops best. Had the root beer float last time. Though it did taste exactly like what it was, it is hard to beat the perfect texture and flavor of the vanilla bean. The fruit pops are delish, don't get me wrong...but the creamier ones hit the spot for me. While we sat there the other day a young man of maybe 3 ran in with his pop holder (they have those for little kids so they can NOT get it all over them and hang onto the handle better - brilliant!) and just started dancing at the counter chanting ""lime, lime, lime"". I think he was a regular and I think he had a favorite.The flavors change a bit so try something new...if you don't like your choice they will exchange it for one you do. That is terrific! I can't decide which one will be your favorite. So let me just say, go, try a pop for $3 and sit a spell.Decent parking, Very friendly staff. Open, clean space. Sit and watch them make the pops and relax a while."
1248,8/12/2017,Kristina T.,houston,5,"After leaving DTX and having a few Steel City Pops there, I missed the sweet pops when I came home to good ol' H-TOWN. Since SCP came to Houston, I never have to miss it again. I've loved every flavor I've had so far from Sweet Tea to Coffee to Blood Orange, it's all good. My favorite, is Blood Orange though, its nice a fruity and gives a good amount of sweetness. SCP also gives you the option to add drizzles of chocolate, different toppings, and even dip your pop into chocolate. Basically, what I'm telling you is it's perfect for cute Instagram and Snapchat shots, y'all! I think this is a perfect treat for the extreme Texas heat we deal with in Houston and I've already brought all my friends and their momma's here to try it out. FYI, you can even take some home in little handy packages that help minimize your popsicles from melting a bunch on your way home!"
1249,7/30/2017,Christine R.,houston,5,Their pops are delicious. If I lived closer I would come more often. Their coconut is my favorite.
1250,12/28/2016,Gia C.,houston,4,"Unique flavors and A few basic flavors, check.  Just wish they gave a heads up when a flavor will no longer be there.  Tried the jalapeño pine apple - spicy?  Yes.  Vanilla bean - more on the sweet sugary side more than vanilla.Gingerbread cream cheese (seasonal) - heavy like cookie dough texture but ginger bread flavor where I didn't notice the cream cheese.  After couple of bites, it's just too much.  I'll stick w regular baked ginger bread only.My flavor pick was coconut.  Only cause I figured out you must do the add on with the creamy pops.  So mine was dipped in milk chocolate, sprinkled w pistachio (while pieces) which she was not shiesty with so points there.  Forgot to dust. So have to remember, and it's free!  Only a buck to dip and sprinkle, so don't be cheap and do it.  You are already paying 3 bucks a pop.Plus parking is available with a nice Amt of space for a group.  Very nice clean decor inside and out.  Which gives it an extra star, and customer service.  If you need it to go, they give you a nice ziploc bag with dry ice.  I would go for the 4 pops for 11 bucks, just cause I like to try more than one flavor.Remember, dip...sprinkle and dust!  Or it just a regular pop, but with super strong flavors, not like your grocery store pops."
1251,8/20/2017,Christine A.,houston,5,"This place was awesome! They offer fruity or creamy popsicles that you can do up pretty much however you want. I had their lavender lemonade; very refreshing. The kiddo had the strawberry cream dipped in white chocolate with milk chocolate drizzle dusted with cocoa powder. The hubs went ""nuts""; vanilla dipped in milk chocolate, drizzled with caramel, ""drudged"" with pecans, and dusted with espresso...oh my goodness! Super tasty! I would definitely come back to try their other flavors like the pineapple jalapeño or matcha or avocado. The establishment is cute and very modern looking. Their outdoor patio is dog-friendly. Two solid thumbs up here."
1252,8/4/2017,Charline N.,houston,5,"I was afraid of my cookie pop being overwhelming but it tastes amazing, great for this summer heat!!!"
1253,8/10/2017,Asia A.,houston,5,"AMAZING! I wish it was closer to where I'd live but I guess I'm glad it's not or I'd be in trouble! I've tried many of the flavors but my favorite is forever the lime! It's just so refreshing and delicious. It's easy to eat two or three each time I visit. I just had a coconut cream one and it tastes JUST like a cocada (Mexican coconut cluster) because the coconut is toasted. The like cucumber one is good! A lot more cucumber than lime but it would be PERFECT with some tajin. They offer different ""dusts"" but they don't have tajin. I didn't love the brownie popsicle. The brownie is gluten free so it's very rich just not my fave but I'm not a chocolate lover so that could be why. I wish they'd bring the cookie dough flavor that they have in dallas but they tend to have new flavors year round. This place is great, try them all!"
1254,7/10/2017,Tina L.,houston,4,"Wow ever since they started doing the ""make your own pop"" it reminds me of popbar in California. I made my own pop and have one of the regular flavors and it's really good. I'm glad that make started to do the make your own pop! Now when I crave for popbar I can just come here."
1255,3/16/2017,Jon B.,houston,4,"I don't find myself around the Heights area too often but I like their pops. 4 stars all day long. Nice sized, natural, flavorful pops. Nice selection. I don't have the current flavor list but there are fruit and milk based pops and are both are around $3 a pop. Shouldn't have too hard a time selecting a pop or two to take home."
1256,7/28/2017,Jessica T.,houston,5,"Such a neat concept and perfect for a refreshing break from Houston's summer heat! These are the flavors I've tried:- Strawberry lemonade- Passionfruit - my favorite!- Pineapple jalapeño - interesting. Not for everyone- blueberry basil- coffee (creamy)- strawberry shortcake (creamy)- avocado (creamy) - DO NOT GET... has a sour taste, could not finish itEach is only $3 and dusting is free of charge!!"
1257,7/27/2017,Mohammad E.,houston,5,"Very cool place that I wish I came across much sooner. It's a great place to chill in the heights with friends, or grab a quick dessert and go. They have every kind of popsicle flavor you can think of, including the chocolate ones. There's a separate room that has a ping pong table so after you grab some dessert you can hop on the table. It's a very low key spot that I definitely recommend going to if you're in the heights area"
1258,4/7/2017,John D.,houston,5,"I heart these pops.Whether you get them fruity or creamy, you can get them dipped in chocolate and or nuts and it's delish. The little game room with a ping pong table is good for letting the wee ones get some energy out of their system. Plus it's walking distance to some pretty good restaurants. If you're in the Heights, this is a primo dessert pick."
1259,9/22/2016,Kevin G.,houston,5,"I LOVE this place!  I originally went to the Greenville location in Dallas a couple weeks ago after I grabbed a bowl of tasty ramen from Wabi House.  This location in Houston is definitely a lot more spacious!  They have a separate area for guests to play ping pong or just chill.So far, I've tried the horchata, chai tea and mango pops.  One can definitely tell these pops are homemade.  Which, by the way, are made in house.  I could actually taste pieces of mango and not just the juice!  So refreshing in this Texas summer heat.  I think; however, I'm more of a fan of their creamy pops like the horchata and chai tea.  I mean, c'mon.  Horchata and chai tea pops?  Genius!Be sure you ask them for one of their Frequent Buyer Cards.  Buy 10, get the 11th one free.  All the POPs are $3 each.  Don't be complaining or saying, ""Oh, that's too expensive.""  Shoot you pay 5 buckeroos on coffee at Starbucks."
1260,9/1/2016,DeHorne S.,houston,4,"The epitome of hipster joint. Cool looking contemporary, minimalistic faculty, dog friendly porch, lack of adequate parking and concrete benches inside are all ingredients for a hipster joint.The selection is simple, this place serves popsicles with a variety of interesting flavors, such as hibiscus, pineapple jalapeno, blueberry basil and much more. They also supply you with calorie counts to let you know what you're putting in your body. There was a line when I went on a Sunday afternoon that went rather quickly.They also have more creamy popsicles if that is what you would rather have. Note that is i about 100 calories more than your fruit based ones. The seating area is rather interesting, there are places to sit immediately when you finish putting in your order that is next to the wall. In the next room, you can witness how the popsicles are made. They also have a porch that can also serve as a general room. There is randomly a ping pong table in there as well. Overall great neat little place with hipster ""artisan popsicles""."
1261,6/21/2017,Ashley T.,houston,5,"This is an interesting business concept. Who would think that selling Popsicles ONLY could be a winner? I love all the different flavors that you can get and loooove how you can outfit the different Popsicles (i.e. adding cookies, chocolate, etc). All of the calorie information is posted so it's up to you to make a bad decision...or a better one. Haha. I opted for making a bad decision - getting a strawberry lemonade pop. Only 97 calories. It was great, but should have enhanced it with some chocolate..or something. But will save that for next time. The pop was surprisingly bold with flavor and did not taste ""too sweet.""  Definitely a great spot if looking to get a refreshing, cost effective dessert."
1262,7/12/2017,J B.,houston,5,"steel city pops is amazing!! My coworker introduced me to this little gem in the heights. The service is amazing. The line moves swiftly and the pops are delicious. My first time there I got the pineapple jalapeño. *insert praise dancing gif^! It wasn't overwhelmingly spicy due to the jalapeños and the pineapple tasted amazing!! I ordered four more to go for my family.  The avocado, strawberry cream, vanilla bean and chocolate. The togo packaging kept my popsicles frozen on my trip back to Pearland. The vanilla bean was very well received. I tried the avocado and it taste just like a nice creamy avocado. The space is also really nice and they have a ping pong table to play while you enjoy your popsicles. I also like the fact that they give you a popsicle rest instead of putting in on the plastic or a napkin. I will definitely be a frequent visitor at Steel City Pops."
1263,8/9/2017,David N.,houston,4,I had a chance to experience their pops via white linen nights.  They had a nice little cart to help us deal with the heat and humidity.  Their passionfruit was very flavorful.  It was $1 less than their competitors too.  I'll have to visit their store at some point to try out some of their other items.
1264,8/1/2016,Jinkie G.,houston,3,My son and I got the cantaloupe pop and the strawberry shortcake pop. Both were just OK. Nothing spectacular. Hopefully we'll be back to try more flavors.Quick service. Good amount of seating.
1265,7/23/2016,John L.,houston,5,"Best popsicles ever. Some flavors are weird, like avocado lime, but don't be scared. Everything is amazing. Haven't tried a flavor I didn't like yet!If you're watching calories get one of the fruity bars. Otherwise, creamy is the way to go. Steel City is my new go to place in the heights for dessert... at least for now. (Sorry Fat Cat)"
1266,4/7/2017,Marya S.,houston,5,Such a cute popsicle place with spacious. So glad my coworkers took us here after lunch. I had the sweet tea popsicle and it tastes exactly like sweet tea. My coworker had the coconut one. Both are delicious! Definitely coming back.
1267,6/18/2017,Iris T.,houston,5,My first time going and It did not disappoint. I went to the one in Lower Greenville (Dallas area) all the workers were very friendly and helpful.
1268,7/2/2016,Lyn N.,houston,5,"I'm sooooo in love with Steel City Pops and so happy they finally opened. I swear I've been waiting since they announced in 2015! Nothing better than delicious, refreshing popsicles in Houston heat. They got fruity pops, creamy pops, coffee, and t shirts. The glass windows to their kitchen allows you to watch their popsicle makin magic. I tried avocado and strawberry lemonade at their Dallas location so I can't imagine it being that much different here. I prefer avocado though. Flavors tried here in best tasting order: watermelon, champagne white tea, cookies & cream, peach cream, mango, vanilla bean, peach, strawberry shortcakeStrawberry shortcake has a slab of cookie dough in the middle so it was more like strawberry & cookies. Watermelon, champagne white tea, & mango is refreshing and not too sweet. Peach cream is creamy but not too heavy. Vanilla bean tastes like dryers ice cream on a stick. It was really creamy and a smidgen too sweet. Peach had real fuzzy peach bits which is good but I wish it was just the flesh. Regardless, they're all worth trying and they change their flavors all the time. P.S. I edit this review each time I try new flavors, and I usually try 4 at a time :) don't judge me. Don't forget your punch card!Edit: they recently added a ping pong table! And for those complaining about the flavors, you can exchange your pop for another flavor if you don't like it! For free!!"
1269,2/15/2017,Sandy A.,houston,5,"I'm kind of in love with the whole concept of Steel City Pops (I mean, just their name is so cool). They make such a variety of flavors, including some pretty unique ones, and have both fruity popsicles and cream based ones. They have amazing customer service and a room for kids to go run around in like crazy while the adults buy and attempt to feed them their delicious desserts. They also have lovely cookie pops.The staff are always super nice and super efficient. They somehow manage to make every customer feel valued and special. Thank you guys!Steel city pops is an experience anyone living in the Houston area should definitely try out. The prices are cheap, parking is usually easy to find, and they make amazing popsicles. Definitely recommend!"
1270,7/1/2016,Nick M.,houston,5,"I've got 99 problems and my 99th review ain't one. Ok, I might be cheating here because I came on the soft opening of SSP and everything was FREEEEEE!  So probably not fair to give this a 5 star review quite yet.  But, to be honest, the pops were pretty tasty! I had an Avocado pop which was creamy, tangy and delicious.  Then I had the Blood Orange which was fruity and super refreshing.  Topped it off with a cappuccino that was good, but coulda been frothier.  The dining room isn't finished yet, just a concrete slab. But the staff were friendly and helpful. I'll be back for a full review later. Come check it out in the now booming northern heights!"
1271,8/14/2016,Ruby D.,houston,5,"I've been once or twice a week since they've opened and would probably come way more if I lived closer. I haven't had a flavor I didn't like. Welllllll...except that jalapeño one but even then it was good, just not what I was wanting. (They'll gladly exchange if you don't like)Staff are hit or miss. Some are great +super personable and others are very slow moving + their age shows. They have that whole frequent buyer card punch system. -Buy 10 individual get one free. -Buy 10 4-packs get one free. Still perplexes me... like, can I buy 4-individual ones and put it in a To go bag?Typically always busy. I've never had an issue with seating though so that's been nice!It's a great addition to the Heights and Houston, in general. The faves so far have been mostly on the creamy side: coconut/horchata/vanilla bean. Blood orange and watermelon are yummies, too. I tell everyone about this place and drag all of em with me. Steel City Pops 4ev"
1272,7/14/2016,Jessica V.,houston,4,"Tucked away in a pretty quaint part of the Heights, Steel City Pops commanded the block. It was a bit larger than anticipated but also had a good number of parking spots. The main/middle room is where you order your pops, the left side is an area to enjoy your pop and the cars passing by, and the right side has a window to watch the employees make the pops. Wish there was more seating in the left side of the establishment though. We sat down on a bench after the family that was there first went back into the main room and got some pretty intense stares from their toddler when they came back.Anyways... at 3 bucks a pop, it's fairly affordable although buying in bulk is probably the better deal. 4 pops in a to-go bag for 11 bucks is their current offer. I came in with my siblings on a Wednesday night and man, that place was packed. Fruity pop: blueberry basil: (3/5) - I usually love blueberries but this pop was just ""meh"". I found myself chewing on blueberry skin more than I would have liked. Fruity pop: blood orange (5/5) - This pop hit the nail on the head. Super refreshing for those hot Houston nights.Creamy pop: vanilla bean (4/5) - As Hong pointed out, the taste was more of an vanilla than a vanilla bean. Be sure to get a frequent buyer/punch card when you stop by!"
1273,8/3/2017,Amanda G.,houston,5,"I've seen lines out the door before but was lucky enough to stop by at open on a Thursday for my 1st visit. A very cute, pleasant and informative lady employee helped with me and my bf's transaction.  I thoroughly enjoyed myself at this super cute lil pop shop. During my visit I heard TLC, Nsync, Spice Girls, Backstreet Boys and other 90's pop music on the radio so as a 30 yr former teeny bopper, I was enjoying myself quite a bit. No shame. I got caught up in the experience but go here! Their flavors our delicious, too!"
1274,7/22/2016,Kathy T.,houston,5,"This is one of my favorite Popsicle places! The Houston location is very spacious, unlike the Dallas one. On the far left, there's a indoor lounge area and far right is an open kitchen. All the fruity flavors are light and refreshing. My favorite is the vanilla cookie pop. If you love cookie dough as much as I do, this is your pop! There's a soft cookie merged in between creamy vanilla ice cream."
1275,7/7/2016,Christine L.,houston,3,"Steel City Flop.Came here on a H O T summer day in Houston to cool down. The space is really nice and the customer service is excellent, so I'll give you points there! Everyone was really friendly! Huge space and there is even a window where you can watch them make the pops! There is a large parking lot, so no worries there.The pops were average, but you need better than average pops to survive in the Heights. $3 a pop. There are different pops you can try: Fruity or Creamy. We went with creamy expecting milky and smooth. We got three different flavors: Coffee, Coconut and Strawberry Shortcake (as recommend by one of the employees). The flavor was there but when you say a pop is 'creamy', I expect it to be rich. The Strawberry Shortcake was a little weird too. It's like uncooked shortcake inside the pop. Pass on this. Might give it another chance on the fruity bars."
1276,6/26/2017,Joann V.,houston,5,Vanilla bean. Creamy delightful dreamsicle! Great atmosphere that keep you wanting more pops for this summer weather.
1277,7/12/2016,Sue N.,houston,4,"This place is cute, hip, and all natural or organic. There's a whole room designated to just sit and chill. Seats were only available along the wall from what I saw, so there's a huge empty room for standing. There are a few benches and high seats available in the main room too. The open view to watching popsicle making is a nice addition, something to entertain you while you enjoy your pop. I tried four flavors: Coconut, Strawberry Lemonade, Coffee, and Cantaloupe. The coconut was my favorite out of these four and can be considered really really sweet. It was really creamy and the coconut flakes remind me of caramel delights. The cantaloupe was rather interesting. Immediately I thought it was way too sweet and it was not something I could chomp down fast. I had to take baby bites to enjoy it. There were also small chunks of cantaloupe in the popsicle. But I probably wouldn't order this again.Strawberry lemonade was refreshing! It has strawberry seeds sprinkled on top, so if you're allergic to strawberry seeds, do avoid. Coffee flavor needed to be a little bit stronger and creamier. Imagine eating a lighter version of haagen daz coffee. I was really expecting a strong coffee flavor and a creamy texture to be similar to that of the coconut. I will be back to try more flavors like Avocado, Chocolate and Caramel. If only these were low-cal... The 4-pop bag comes with an ice pack, however, the bag itself is not insulated so I would say 15 minutes tops would be ideal for transit time in the bag before your creamy popsicle begins to melt. This place is definitely great to bring your kids or for an after dinner dessert treat. They also serve coffee here and Provid water, where 100% of the proceeds is donated to NeverThirst."
1278,5/29/2017,Shauna R.,houston,5,Coconut popsicle dipped in dark chocolate and dredged in pistachios and drizzled with caramel. So good!
1279,8/1/2017,Kalia B.,houston,5,"Came here for the first time and all I have to say is OH.EM.GEE! I got the jalapeño/pineapple and it was soooooo good! My best friend got the avocado one but said it tasted more like key lime pie, which wasn't bad but just wasn't what she was expecting. I love how they have seasonal flavors too and are always changing it out. However, I will say that $3 a pop is a little expensive but you do get a big popsicle so I guess that makes up for it."
1280,8/12/2017,Lisa L.,houston,5,This place has the best popsicles anywhere around! I had tried steel pops in Dallas and never knew that they had opened up one close to my neighborhood in Houston so I was very excited to come and Order some popsicles to eat now and some for later LOL. And they just started doing a chocolate dip dredge and toppings plus dusting on their popsicles which I've never seen I think I will be coming to this one quite often for now on when I want a sweet treat.
1281,7/9/2016,Kimmi D.,houston,5,"As good as the one in Dallas! This location is very big with the main area where you order and pay, and then another area with more room to sit and for kids to run around, and another room where you can see them making the popsicles (which is pretty cool!). You can choose between a creamy or fruity popsicle, and each type has different variety of flavors. I came around 8pm on a Saturday and I didn't find my favorite flavors lavender lemonade or champagne white tea on the menu, so they probably ran out. Be sure to get there earlier in the day! Yay for Steel City Pops opening up here! Welcome to Houston :)"
1282,8/19/2017,Kelvin D.,houston,5,Everything is great there you can close your eyes and pick something you will not go wrong I personally like the creamy side because of the cookie.
1283,10/10/2016,Megan C.,houston,4,"Glad we decided to try this place. It was fun and they had a lot of creative flavors to choose from. I also enjoyed watching them make them. I had the blackberry basil which was really good but left lots of stuff in my teeth. I also would have liked actual tables and less kids running around. Still fun and I enjoyed it. It's a popsicle, not rocket surgery :-)"
1284,8/30/2017,Henesis M.,houston,4,"Nice place to get a much needed popsicle in this Houston heat! Definitely my go to place when I need to cool down, in the yummiest of ways :)"
1285,12/19/2016,Miso D.,houston,5,I love this place! I can't keep away! Mint chocolate and coffee are my favorite flavors! I dip my coffee in milk chocolate and coated it in pecans and drizzle with caramel!!
1286,11/7/2016,Kelsey M.,houston,5,"What a wonderful surprise to find this place in my new neighborhood!  We've been a few times and have trouble choosing from the yummy flavors and 'dressings' to go on them. I can't say I'd ever think a creamy vanilla bourbon with bacon pop would be good but I swear by how awesome it is!  They have a huge selection with dairy, non-dairy, teas, fruits and other interesting concoctions.  The staff here is very friendly. There is a free frequent shopper card. The place is clean and has a pingpong table if you're feeling Forrest Gump (this place started in Birmingham, AL). There's plenty of parking and they make the pops on site where people can watch."
1287,8/9/2017,Ileana P.,houston,5,"I arrived early one Thursday to play blanket bingo bingo in Market Square Park and there was a stand and a boy that everyone was passing up. During intermission there was a big crowd around him and I thought ""eh, let's give them a try"" I'm a sucker for ""paletas"" and as I've said before, I have high expectations coming from a Mexican background. These ""paletas"" were so good!! They had a lot of choices I couldn't make up my mind. I liked them so much I been meaning to go to their shop and buying a dozen to take home!"
1288,9/24/2016,Casey C.,houston,5,Boyfriend and I decidedly to randomly stop here and I am so glad we did! I had the peanut butter pop... and I was in peanut butter heaven. My boyfriend had the mango pop and he said it's the best he has ever had! And they're only 3$!!! The atmosphere is really nice... different types of people enjoying their pops together!
1289,7/26/2017,Kristin R.,houston,5,"This place is great. The pops are delicious and the staff is friendly. My favorite flavor so far is the blood orange. Other great flavors we've tried: cantaloupe, root beer, cucumber lime, and watermelon."

Updated review",Kim P.,houston,5,flavor reviews;avocado; just tastes like avocado that's really it. boringstrawberry lemonade; awesome! lots of flavor!!peach; meh kinda weird; not very sweet or flavorful buttermilk; pretty good with the right amount of sweet and cookie part was good toopineapple jalapeno ; one of my favorites not overly spicy and the pineapple tastes great in a ice pop
1291,4/24/2017,Valerie H.,houston,4,"These pops are really fresh and delicious. From fruity (real fruit ingredients) to creamy (like ice cream), there's a pop for everyone. They even have options to 'dress' your pop...with sprinkles, dips, etc. Lots of benches and indoor seating, and even a dog friendly indoor patio."
1292,9/20/2016,Vanessa B.,houston,5,"Stopped in here on a Saturday afternoon. Parking was a plenty. It was sort of crowded inside, but no line to order. Ordering is super fast since they just pull your popsicles and take your money. I got the peanut butter and it was really good, husband got the strawberry lemonade and loved it. Both had lots of flavor. I think it would be fun one day to go and play ping pong there too."
1293,7/4/2017,Robyn C.,houston,5,Wow! Nice variety. Cucumber lime was really flavorful and refreshing! I'll head back pretty soon to try another flavor.
1294,12/18/2016,Joseph W.,houston,4,Pricey but goodIt's always busy on the weekends and they have a very very simple menuDon't forget they have coffee and all the hot yummy that a cold night wouldn't serve up ice cream
1295,7/1/2017,Veronica C.,houston,5,"We can't wait to go back for more!!! Reasonable prices, and great flavors. Top it off with a cool space for taking pictures and playing ping pong."
1296,7/28/2016,Ann T.,houston,3,"Being from Dallas, I didn't need to come to Steel City immediately. Waited a few weeks before checking it out and I'm certainly glad I did. There was no line when I came in Wednesday afternoon. Yay!Had the blueberry basil this time around, yum, very pulpy. Service is friendly, space is HUGE when you compare it to the Dallas location. Very clean, lots of parking and fun to watch them actually craft the popsicles. Do I think it's overpriced? Yes, but its nice to indulge every once in awhile."
1297,7/12/2017,M B.,houston,5,Finally tired these pops. I had the Strawberry Lemonade and it was so delicious and fresh. Full of strawberries with a hint of citrus. I have been craving another for days . I will be back very very soon!
1298,7/21/2016,Mi A.,houston,5,"Me and my daughter ventured out today to visit SCP....  We reviewed the menu and we both gravitated to the creamy side.... The menu is divided into creamy or juicy I would call it... she selected the Caramel pop and I selected the strawberry short cake pop.... I started reminiscing about the strawberry short cake pop I use to get from the ice cream truck but this one was way way better with a short cake inside... As for my daughter she loved her caramel pop...  As we where finishing up my daughter already planned her return selection from the juicy side ""watermelon"" and I replied I guess I will have the blood orange!"
1299,4/30/2017,Sanna A.,houston,5,Beautiful. Great freshly made popsicles you can dip in chocolates and nuts. Great side room with ping pong. Great concept. Definitely coming back!
1300,6/22/2017,Faye C.,houston,5,"The inside was super chic and cute, you can actually watch them prepare the pops in the kitchen! I've never been to a place that just sells pops but I would definitely go back. The staff was also friendly and able to answer all my questions.I bought the 4 pack with avocado (tastes literally just like a mushed avocado with lime), coconut (the toasted flakes through out were really good), peach cream (kind of like pie?) and for an extra $1 cookies and cream (super good!)!A friend of mine bought peach and she was a little disappointed that it wasn't super sweet, it's more of a natural sweetness which is better for you anyways.My only issue was that the wrappers weren't labeled and we were a little confused trying to guess by color which was which. Otherwise it was great!"
1301,8/12/2016,Christy P.,houston,5,"Do you ever drink something so delicious, you wish it came in edible form? Enter the horchata popsicle. I love horchata, and this popsicle was just as delicious as the drink...that creaminess plus the kick of cinnamon? Heavenly! I honestly can't get it off my mind. My friend's blueberry basil was delicious, but not super heavy on the basil. I tried the blood orange too and it was lighter but still tasty. Great citrus flavor that's not too bitter or sweet.They're $3 each, and they have fruity pops if you want something light and refreshing, and creamy pops if you want something more indulgent (which I almost always do). Overall...love."
1302,9/26/2016,Nicole S.,houston,5,"What's better than an ice cold popsicle to counter a hot (and humid) Houston afternoon?Great flavors and great service make Steel City one of my favorite dessert establishments!  At $3 a pop (you can save $1 if you buy a 4 pack for $11), you can satisfy your sweet tooth without breaking the bank.  PRO TIP: if you don't like your flavor, just tell the counter and they will swap it out for another flavor, free of charge.There are two types of flavors: Fruity and CreamyFruity:Seasonal fruits!  Some are sweeter than others, so make sure you ask about the sweetness level (if you prefer less sweet). - Blueberry Basil: fresh and delicious with just the right amount of sweetness - Blood Orange: great orange flavor - Passionfruit: my personal favorite of the fruity, tangy and sweet!Creamy:Rich flavors, much like ice cream!  Creamy and delicious. - Coconut: TO DIE FOR, the best flavor of the bunch.  Great coconut creaminess with flakes on the bottom - Coffee: great coffee flavor cut with just the right amount of creamI haven't tried the cookie pops yet, but looking forward to coming back and trying the Cookies and Cream and Strawberry Shortcake!!"
1303,9/26/2016,Olivia Y.,houston,4,"The place was big. The staff was informative and nice to all my questioning about the flavors. The popsicles were on point. I chose the Blueberry Basil and the bf had Coconut. Both very fresh and made of the actual ingredients. I would see myself paying the hefty price for the popsicle but not often as I'd like too :/ Either way, I'd bring my friends and/or family here because there is a separated rest area that's attached to the store that's pretty big enough to fit a large family or a group of friends (aside the other customers). It's also cool enough to not worry about your popsicle melting right then and there :)"
1304,6/21/2017,Stephanie F.,houston,5,"At first I thought ""an ice pop ... really?  How much better can they be?"" These are the Best Ice pop I have ever tasted !  Unfortunately they are better in texture than the ones I make at home . The ingredients are all natural and gluten free so you betcha I'll be back !"
1305,7/7/2016,Giang N.,houston,5,"The owners of this chain are geniuses.  Imagine the profit margin on popsicles. Haha.  I came here on a Wednesday night and the parking lot was mostly full. For $3 you pick between a variety of popsicles in the creamy or fruity category.  I highly recommend going with the creamy popsicles (watch out though - they're 3 times the calories, too :P).  I tried the passion fruit and the buttermilk.  The passion fruit was tasty, but I much prefer the buttermilk.  The creamy popsicles have a nice flaky/dense texture yet has the full flavor of regular ice cream.  It almost came off as a nice smooth cheese cake.  Overall, I'd definitely come back for this treat.  $3 dollars is not too bad for a nice dessert or a snack.  I think next time I will try the coconut or caramel flavor.Edit: I just came here again. Second day in a row now...  Haha.  My girlfriend is a huge fan.   I tried coconut today and it was great.   She ended up buying a four pop bag today (3 buttermilk and a coconut for me).   There you have it - creamy pops are the winners!  Also, I think they've earned themselves a 5 star -  best Popsicles I've ever had."
1306,7/19/2016,Liz H.,houston,4,"Perfect summer time snack to beat this Houston heat!Service: no wait and friendly help explaining each of the flavorsAmbiance: very spacious with some main bar seating allowing you to people watch outside the wide Windows. Also a side seating room allowing more people to enjoy their Popsicle in air conditioning. On the other side of the main room, there is a large window allowing you to look into the making of the natural made Popsicles. Lots of parking available too. The only downside is the location is a big far for people who don't live in the heights. Nevertheless I can't wait to come back and try the new flavors. I would love if they had a Mangonada flavor! The strawberry lemonade was refreshing, the seeds settle to the top of the Popsicle which unfortunately would get stuck in my teeth. Maybe blending the seeds in would make it more manageable to eat."
1307,7/10/2016,Jackie K.,houston,5,"I LOVE this place! I was a fan of the Dallas location, and I'm so happy it's here in Houston now.  They have both creamy and fruity pops, and both are fantastic.  (Though they list the calories on the menu, and the fruity pops are definitely less caloric.) I can say that I've had quite a few of their different flavors, and ALL of them are excellent--you really can't go wrong with any of them, though I'd say that the peanut one is especially yummy.  And...they also have cookie pops, which are a rectangular cookie inside of a regular pop. Best of both worlds."
1308,6/12/2017,Johannah A.,houston,5,"Really yummy and so true to flavor!! I got the blood orange and my friend got the peach and we both agreed that it was like eating the actual fruit. There's a variety of both fruity & creamy pops to choose from, and the decor and ambiance is really hip and summery inside. Definitely want to come back to try other flavors!"
1309,6/10/2017,Ali B.,houston,5,Awesome ice cream place so good... I love it a lot. A really great place to hang out and hon for desert with your family friends cousins and everyone else.
1310,7/15/2016,Kacy M.,houston,4,The only good thing about Dallas has come to Houston...yay! This location is huge and has indoor seating. I love the HTown mural on the wall. I got the blood orange and my friend got the blueberry and basil (both $3 each). There's a window from the outside you can view the workers making the Popsicles which is pretty neat to watch.
1311,7/26/2016,Jeremy T.,houston,5,"Was definitely excited when I got the news Steel City Pops was opening in Houston! Situated in a pleasant area, with a decent amount of parking, Steel City Pops awakened my newly found love for popsicles.I figured that anyone can make popsicles but these guys are different! I've tried 2 flavors, blueberry basil and coffee, which are the 2 types of pops they offer, Fruity or Creamy. Both are delicious and tastes even better on a hot summer day, basically every day in Houston. The blueberry basil pop is what it is, and neither ingredient overpowers the other. Coffee, well, is always delicious, but the pop was AMAZING. All in all a great place to ""chill"". Forgive me. Will be visiting often!"
1312,8/12/2016,Becka C.,houston,4,"I've been a fan of this place since I visited in Dallas. And I'm happy they opened a location in Houston! I tried a new flavor on my visit, the blueberry basil pop and it was delicious. There were bits of blueberry pieces in it so you can tell it was fresh. If there's a line, it moves pretty quickly and the staff is really friendly. Now they have a patio area connected to the side for you to sit and enjoy your pop. And it's dog friendly!"
1313,2/28/2017,Xavier F.,houston,4,Great variety and love the options of lower sugar on the fruit based. If your looking to splurge in calories try the coffee milk pop wonderful any time of day. They also allow you to dip and sprinkle your popsicle. It creates a truly decadent flavor mix to appease any appetite.
1314,7/18/2016,Trevor C.,houston,5,"Perfect spot for a refreshing popsicle or creamsicle after an evening out with friends. I dropped in after a workout  and it was the perfect fix to my dehydrated overheated state. They have a great assortment of flavored popsicles (coffee, avocado, berry, etc.) that are low calories and delicious -- I personally love the vanilla bean creamsicle. The venue is very urban and looks like a great spot for good conversation over some coffee (which they serve) and yummy desserts. Take a date here ASAP!"
1315,7/16/2016,Laura S.,houston,4,"It's the middle of July, so one must cool down with a popsicle. I saw this new place and had to check it out. Popsicle:Our order of popsicles consisted of 1-watermelon, 1-mango and 1-coffee. The watermelon and mango were very tasty and refreshing. The coffee had a great flavor and creaminess to it. The size of the popsicle was generous. The price was only $3 for each. It's definitely a place to come back again and try another flavor. Overview:You can't miss it from the street. Love the concept, location, price and layout. When you walk in you'll order at the walk up counter. Over to the right, you'll see the part of the ""kitchen"". This is where you see workers making popsicles. To the left, there's an area to have people hangout and eat their popsicles. I saw lots of kiddos with their parents in that area. You can sit in the main room counter while you eat your popsicle. Staff was very friendly."
1316,8/22/2016,Jeri A.,houston,4,These Popsicles are super yummy! I tried the horchata flavor and my friend had the coconut. Both are delicious! You can choose from 2 kinds of Popsicles: fruity and creamy. Get a stamp card because you will be back!
1317,10/7/2016,Ashley C.,houston,5,"Let me just start by saying how much I love popsicles. I make my own at home so I appreciate that they make their own in house using local ingredients. When I came here with my boyfriend and a few of our friends it was a Tuesday night and not crowded at all, which was nice. There are a variety of flavors, some fruity and some creamy. I had the toasted marshmallow popsicle and it was delicious! Tasted a bit more like caramel than marshmallows but I love caramel too, so that's okay. Very creamy and just the right amount of sweetness. My boyfriend had the strawberry lemonade which was also very tasty. After we ordered our popsicles we went to the room next door that has a ping pong table and my friends played for a little while. It's a large room so even when more people came in there was still plenty of room to hang out. I will definitely be coming back here to try more flavors. They have a smoked fig and cheese popsicle that I want to try because..well, why not?"
1318,8/17/2016,Maggie Z.,houston,4,"Refreshing summer treats! I love that they put the calories on each of the popsicle flavors. Theres a decent amount of parking, considering the place's location. This a great place to pop into, grab a treat, and continue on out."
1319,8/1/2016,Lisa B.,houston,4,Delicious pops ! They have fruit and cream based. We had coconut and pineapple jalapeño. Both were good.. Pineapple jalapeño definitely had a kick. Reminded me of a pineapple fruit cup with chili ! Perfect for a summer day. Quick service despite it being crowded!
1320,8/14/2016,Moises G.,houston,5,"This place takes my childhood memories of the paletero man to a whole new level. It will never replace the $1 Mexican paletas but it's good all in its own.They make their pops in house (you can see them working through the glass). They have trays for the savory seeking and the sweet wishing.Decently priced given the specialty product.The watermelon- great flavor, not too much ice crystal, simply cool juice.The Horchata was just what I wanted. A creamy treat. True to taste. Smooth."
1321,8/3/2016,Kawanza E.,houston,5,"Such a great popsicle! Steel City Pops is a great place for adults and kids alike. There's enough seating to enjoy your pop in the restaurant, and a cute patio where there's a 100% chance you will see giddy kids enjoying their delicious pops as well. I devoured the pineapple jalapeño pop  (btw, I'm still thinking about it) and can't wait to go back to try additional flavors."
1322,7/19/2016,Grace P.,houston,5,"Gourmet pops seem to be the new thing, and I can tell you that THIS is what all other companies are trying to emulate. Each pop is $3. You can get a pack of 4 for $11. Just go ahead and get yourself the 4 pack - you will want more! My husband and I each got a pop, and then got in line for two more. The 4 pack comes with an insulated pouch and ice pack (both reusable), so this is obviously the best value.The cream based popsicles are wonderfully creamy. Not at all chalky or icy. It was pretty much like eating ice cream on a stick, which is exactly what I wanted. The coffee flavor was my favorite, and will be one I regularly get. It was very well balanced - rich and creamy, while maintaining the bitter ""punch"" I like in a strong espresso. The fruit based pops are intensely fruity, and do not taste artificial or overly sweet. Both blood orange and mango were delicious. The watermelon pop was refreshing, but I didn't like it nearly as much as the others. It probably would've been more interesting with some herbs, like basil or mint.The parking lot is huge for the area, and there is plenty of space to sit or stand. Steel City Pops is the perfect addition to Houston, where a refreshing and cold treat is necessary 9 out of 12 months of the year."
1323,9/18/2016,Harrison D.,houston,4,"Love the fact that this place was open until 11PM on weekends! Such a cute place and the environment was very friendly with a lovely staff! The price is a tad pricey but what else can you expect from a popsicle shop. They have the most adorable shirts, I ended up buying one for myself! My friends & I all tried different flavors:Watermelon: tastes just like a watermelon; very refreshingMango: trued many mango popsicles before and this is by far my favorite!Hibiscus: wasn't at all as good as expected"
1324,7/24/2016,Joseph S.,houston,4,"First visit - quite busy on a HOT Sunday afternoon. Lots of parking.Good selection of fruit vs. cream popsicles - understand the mix changes weekly. We had  watermelon and peanut butter pops. Quite good and very frozen (no drips!).For $3 a ""pop"" - how could you go wrong?"
1325,7/6/2016,Linda T.,houston,4,"Neat idea I saw first in CA. The popsicles are pretty good. The place was pretty cold which I guess works with the theme. Good flavors but I expect those will be changing as they explore. I got 6 popsicles and they were all pretty good: passion fruit, coconut, avocado, strawberry lemonade, and carmel. I am sure this place will only get better. Fun idea."
1326,3/21/2017,Andrew T.,houston,5,"5/5! Upon entry, the ambiance is open and bright. To the right of the entrance you can see into the kitchen and how the popsicles are made. To the left, there is a game room with a ping pong table. It's definitely a cool place to just kick back!The menu is pretty simple. You choose between your two styles of popsicles, either creamy or fruity. You also have the option to dip your popsicle and coat it with different toppings. For roughly $4, I ordered a banana popsicle covered in chocolate, then dredged in graham crackers. It was honestly the best popsicle I've ever had!This place is perfect for a quick dessert bite or a snack. You can even buy popsicles and take them home with you. I will definitely be coming back to Steel City Pops. They really are doing it right!"
1327,5/6/2017,Amber P.,houston,2,Staff at the counter weren't too kind or enthusiastic to be working or answering our questions since it was our first visit. They also forgot our drinks then tried to double charge us without apologizing. Pops were also mediocre. Nothing too exciting. More of a trendy place to try out instead of a quality place that will keep you coming back. We also thought it was a bit pricey.
1328,8/24/2016,Danielle W.,houston,5,"Went here tonight and picked up a 4 pack of pops. I love the decor and there is plenty of seating. And I got a frequent buyer card I picked up strawberry lemonade, watermelon, coffee and chocolate. I ate the chocolate and my husband had the strawberry lemonade both were great!!"
1329,6/13/2017,Courtney K.,houston,5,Two words: HIBISCUS POPSICLE. Easily one of the best frozen treats I've had in a long time. You definitely need to go try it.
1330,2/1/2017,Neha K.,houston,5,They have amazing popsicles!!! We tried the chocolate and the chocolate peanut butter...!! And also it doesn't melt that easily so it's easier to consume and of course along with the amazing flavor! I m surely gonna go there again to try the coconut flavor!
1331,5/30/2017,P G.,houston,5,They have great parking (I'm a stickler for parking) and the prices are incredibly cheap! I would've thought for a really nice looking place that it'd be expensive and mediocre but I was pleasantly surprised
1332,8/8/2017,Lydia A.,houston,5,When I want to cheat and have desert I stop at my favorite place.  The peanut butter and coconut are my favorites.  Also they are great to take a dinner party.    I think it's a great concept especially in Houston.   They cool you off.
1333,9/10/2016,Vincent T.,houston,3,"Hype hype hype hype. Good luck finding parking. Yeah the popsicles are pretty good, but they're still $4 each.  My girlfriend loves this place, she brought 4 popsicles for $11 (yay $1 off so we can buy 1/4 of a popsicle next time). If you ask, they'll give you a cool sealable temperature cooled bag for any popsicles you plan to take home. Taste-wise the Blood Orange was bomb, and Chocolate was basic. Anyways, here's a quick list-Pros: ""unique"" flavors, uber cold so they take a while to melt, ping pong table.Cons: cost of 1 steel city pop = a pack of them at a supermarket, busy place, when it's really busy parking sucks."
1334,6/7/2017,Heather F.,houston,5,"Tried this place a few weeks back and meant to leave a review! Omg literally every flavor there I've tried is amazing!!! Blackberry, cookies and cream, strawberry lemonade, blood orange, vanilla bean and hibiscus! I ate some of everyone's lol. Also I realized you could dip it in chocolate!! Roll it in coconut!!!! Heart be still this place is amazing! Also love the dog friendly patio and the ping pong of course. Totally recommend you try this place out in a group on a hot day!"
1335,8/24/2016,Cameron Y.,houston,4,"What a fun concept and experience! My husband and I checked this place out after eating dinner a few doors down. For my first pop experience I went with the Chai Latte and hubby got the Blueberry Basil. The Blueberry Basil was delicious and had great a richness for a fruity flavor, but my Chai Latte one was by far better. My husband tasted mine and then had pop envy, but because I'm so nice we switched pops after we had each eaten half. Can't wait to come back! Horchata pop, you are next!!"
1336,10/29/2016,Pauline F.,houston,5,Love this place uniquely different great staff happy go lucky that you feel like a kid again loved all the Popsicles especially dipped in milk chocolate dredged and cinnamon and sprinkled with sea salt
1337,11/10/2016,Margaret L.,houston,5,"Delicious! I have been here several times, and each time services is friendly and fast. Lots of parking and room to sit and eat your popsicle."
1338,10/29/2016,Sld D.,houston,5,"I'm going to make an unpopular statement.I do not like popsicles. Never have. Ice cream? Absolutely. Popsicles? Nope. They're too icy, lack flavor, or just taste like the inside of a freezer bin.Steel City has made me a BELIEVER! Their flavor selection is phenomenal, and I believe they will exchange a flavor if you're unhappy (although I've never done it, didn't have to).Right now for fall they have a toasted marshmallow flavor you have to TASTE to believe. They even have ""burnt marshmallow"" crumble at the top of the pop. Have mercy."
1339,5/23/2017,Kimberly S.,houston,5,Delicious. I would go here everyday if I could. The flavors change seasonally so I never get bored! They also have really great coffee. Will be frequently coming here through them summer.
1340,2/26/2017,Cindy L.,houston,5,"I remember my friend reccomended this place and was like ""you need to try the pineapple jalapeno!"" ....and so, I did. It was soooooooo good!!! It was sweet but it had a kick to it. I've had their creamy flavors, like the vanilla bean, and it's good as well. Honestly, all of the popsicles I've had from here are good. I usually gravitate towards their fruity popsicles though. My top favorites from here is the pineapple jalapeno and the strawberry lemonade! I know they've started to do dip pops, so that's what I'll be getting the next time I visit :-)"
1341,8/26/2016,Catherine P.,houston,5,"After trying Steel City Pops in Ft. Worth for the first time this summer, I was hooked and could not wait to go back. So I was really excited when I found out Houston would have its very own location! The pops are equally delicious, but the space is much bigger here. There is a large room for kids to play in, indoor seating, and a parking lot in front. There is no outdoor seating, but it's too hot for that anyway. Personally, I prefer creamy pops over the fruity ones because... well, they are just so creamy! I tried caramel, coconut, hibiscus, mango, and horchata. Coconut and hibiscus were my favorites of the bunch, though I have never tried one I didn't like. Their menu changes every once in a while, which is going to keep me coming back in hopes that my all time favorite creamy peach pop is back."
1342,9/15/2016,Abby R.,houston,3,"So ice cream and any other cold treats are my favorite desserts. I saw all the great reviews for this place and decided to check them out. My first observation is that  for a popsicle store this place is pretty big. They have the main ordering station then 2 additional rooms. One seemed like the place where they make the popsicles but on the day i went it was so busy that i coudnt get a good look at that room. The cashier who helped us was extremely upbeat and very nice. Although it was busy we didnt wait in line very long. I got the bluberry basil and my company got blood orange. We ate them in the adjoining patio which houses some benches in the AC plus theres a ping pong table. So to the most important thing... the popsicles. I was actually a bit dissapointed because although it was a good popsicle, it was just that, a popsicle. Blood orange was tasty too, but i dont know if theyre worth the drive to this location. Maybe i need to try their cream popsicles."
1343,8/17/2016,Brenda L.,houston,5,"I'm not a Popsicle fan but this place sure turned me into one. My favorite flavors here are pina colada, watermelon, and blackberry basil. Love this place!"
1344,11/27/2016,Juan M.,houston,5,Been here 3 times since I found it. The fruit pops are very refreshing and flavorful.
1345,8/14/2016,Aailyah F.,houston,5,"Steel City Pops is the most refreshing and delightful ice cream spots I've been to in a while. The flavors we chose were amazing and the service was good. Also the price isn't TOO bad. Keep in mind it's basically just a gourmet ""paleta""; just like the ones you could get at a smaller convenient store 2 for $1 but WAY better. I must say these are frozen pretty solid so it makes it difficult for you to make a horrible mess or good enough so you have the time to take them home. We purchased 2 Horchata flavor and 1 Mango. Horchata is so good. The Mango was also stellar, but I have to definitely recommend the Horchata. The place was nice and clean and also is dog friendly! Loved this place."
1346,3/21/2017,Dina X.,houston,3,The sorbet is on the sweeter side and I wish it has less sugar in it... not for someone who's on a diet...
1347,7/18/2016,Alice H.,houston,5,"I had seen a ton of my friends snap these delicious looking pops and didn't know where it was from! My friends and I did a small gno recently after work (I know we are such rebels!) and came here for dessert because I had told them I had never had one of these amazing pops before. Of course I was told I was missing out on life and I sure was! This was probably the smartest idea ever to open up something like this in Houston. I love that they have fruity and light and then there is creamy and filling. I had the watermelon pop since it seemed very refreshing after eating at pluckers. It has been by far the best popsicle I have had! You really feel like you are eating a frozen watermelon. I think my popsicle was only 84 calories for you calorie counters out there. Such a great dessert to have on a hot day! My two other friends got a coconut one and a vanilla chocolate cookie! YEAH you heard me right. They put cookies in the popsicle! How crazy is that?! MIND BLOWN! I had a bit of hers and was instantly in love. The coconut one was also a great pick! I just don't think you could go wrong with anything you pick there. I love that you can get pops to go as well and they give you a bag to put them in so that they don't melt on your way home. But in this Texas heat, I would recommend going home right after if you decide to buy some of these delicious pops to go. I cant wait till I come here again because just like how the pokemon craze has been in trying to ""catch them all"", I just wanna try them all!"
1348,9/25/2016,Amrita S.,houston,4,Good place...a tasty pop. Love the adjacent room where people can sit and my 1 yr old could run around. Only complaint is it's a bit overpriced...for a Popsicle
1349,7/13/2016,Katheryn V.,houston,4,"Steel City Pops is definitely one of Houston's gems. At night, their bright lights combined with the glass windows literally light up the entire street. It was fairly crowded when i came but i would have to say that the service was still splendid. The lady that took our order was patient with us and was very helpful. As for the ice cream, it was very refreshing. My siblings ordered the blood orange and the blueberry popsicle and i ordered the vanilla bean. Whenever I visit an ice cream store, if i do not like their classic vanilla, the rest is a no go. Steel city's Vanilla Bean popsicle was spot on. It wasn't too sweet and it definitely had a flavor that i have never found elsewhere. They have an entire room just for customers to sit and hang and enjoy their popsicles. I have never seen a space like that so i was very impressed. I thought it was very clever that they dedicated an entire room just for customers, but it could use more chairs. Needs more parking spaces!!!"
1350,12/12/2016,David O.,houston,5,When we crave a cold popsicle on a cold December night you know you have something others don't. AMAZING
1351,8/16/2016,Soo K.,houston,4,"With all the hub bub, I had to try! I visited twice since my first visit, once with my girlfriend Jennifer and the second time with the husband and kiddo. The pops are $3 and so far I have tried the Mango, Coconut, Avocado and Strawberry Lemonade. All pretty good, the Coconut is the best of the creamy pops, the Strawberry Lemonade for the fruity pops. Fun place!For photos visit my blog!"
1352,10/2/2016,Minkyong Y.,houston,5,"Their popsicle flavors are just delicious!! My husband and I actually crave some of their flavors. We've so far tried the below and I've outlined next to it yum, okay, ew*Chocolate- yum*Vanilla- yum*Blood orange- yum*Blueberry Basil- ew- the blueberry texture gets in the way of the flavor*Horchata- okay- if you're in the mood*strawberry lemonade- yumThe atmosphere is cute. There is a room where you can just chill, enjoy your ice cream and people watch. They have a ping pong table where you can borrow paddles for free by giving your license.Looove this place!"
1353,8/2/2016,Tina L.,houston,5,"For what it is, I absolutely love it. I've had the one in Dallas and was absolutely thrilled when it opened up here in Houston. They are simply put, popsicles. Don't expect anything too crazy, they're simple, but refreshing and delightful. I always get some fruit flavored one and as basic as it may seem, I feel like I'm getting healthier with every lick. They literally taste like the fruit itself was converted to popsicle form. The popsicles are also pre-made for the day so that there is no wait in actually receiving them. You just get what you want and pay out. Staff was friendly, store was very open and trendy. Really casual place to just get a popsicle and hang out."
1354,4/2/2017,Shannon M.,houston,5,"Get the buttermilk! After visiting this place for years at the original Birmingham location, I was thrilled to have them with me in Houston."
1355,7/11/2016,Hong H.,houston,5,"Review of 12 flavors (10 creamy, 2 fruity)I found these creamy pops closest in texture to ice cream and they taste just like you would expect them to. In order of my preference:- Peanut butter - Chocolate- Coconut (too sweet for me though)- Vanilla bean (also too sweet for me, and unfortunately more plain vanilla than vanilla bean) These creamy pops seem more balanced in sweetness perhaps because they have less fat? and therefore have the flaky, creamy ice texture of Chinatown's Nu Ice's snowflake ice.- Caramel- Coffee - Chai LatteIf you are in a more adventurous mood, I'd go with these creamy flavors due to their strangely delicious sour kick.- Avocado - ButtermilkFruity pops I tried that stayed true to their name. Since I didn't feel like I was eating a flower or frozen essential oil or artificial syrup, I'll be back to try more fruity flavors.- Hibiscus - Blueberry Basil Cookie popThe only pop I strongly disliked (vanilla chocolate chip). I paid $1.50 more to have a ""cookie inside a popsicle"" but the cookie, which takes up 1/3 to 1/2 of the pop, tastes like slightly undercooked pie crust or cookie dough to me. Their main office states it is completely cooked but either way I wouldn't buy this one again.Overall at $3 a pop, I would return. Delicious pops can be found at Mexican paleterias in Houston for $1-$2 a pop but this place is close to home and they use natural/organic, locally-harvested ingredients."
1356,9/4/2016,Mollie A.,houston,4,"Finally got to see what all the hype was about. The building is an interesting setup where they have one indoor area where you order Popsicles/coffee/etc. and then to the left there is an indoor area with a few places to sit and ping pong tables. I went on a Saturday and most people were just kind of standing around and hanging out inside and outside. I got 4 Popsicles for take out - hibiscus, coffee, lime, and vanilla bean. Each Popsicle is $3, but $11 for four - and they pack it in a fancy ziplock with an ice pack so it doesn't melt. The hibiscus was okay - the flavors are strong and i found to get a bit tired of the flavor after a couple bites. The vanilla was delicious! And the coffee was strong - which I liked. I haven't tried the lime yet so I don't know how good that one is. I would recommend getting the dairy/creamy flavors over the fruity ones - but that's just personal preference. There's plenty of parking and the staff are very friendly. I wouldn't mind coming back to try out the rest of the flavors!"
1357,4/7/2017,Allison M.,houston,5,"Yum! This place is good. I was skeptical about going somewhere to get ""fancy popsicles"", but it was definitely worth it. The banana pop was delicious and creamy. Good place if you want a cold treat but want something a little lighter than ice cream."
1358,7/6/2016,Mimi N.,houston,5,"I am utterly happy that steel city pops has made its way here to Houston! I would always visit in Dallas and Austin in hopes that one day Houston would also have one. The avocado lime, coffee and butter milk are my favorite creamy flavors. All of the fruity flavors are very refreshing! With time, I hope this location will have more flavors. The prices are a bit steep but it's totally worth it! I came during the day and with the blazing summer, the line was long but trust me when I say, it goes super fast."
1359,7/14/2016,Max N.,houston,3,"Got their vanilla chocolate chip cookie pop...alittle disappointed. The vanilla ice cream was really creamy, but the cookie part was not what I expected. It seemed that the core was just plain cookie dough..also just a little too salty for my taste. I ended up just eating all the ice creams round because it was just too much of the cookie part. Also for the price, overall not worth it. I would come back and try one of their fruit pops instead, but defiantly not the vanilla cookie pop."
1360,8/1/2016,Mai-Trang T.,houston,4,"Definitely a cute little Popsicle shop that has amazing employees and delicious pops! They have fruity pops and they have creamy pops. I'm not a big fan of fruity pops because I don't like icey water based ice cream or Popsicles. I've only tried the creamy ones :)So far....Coconut was absolutely yummy. I just am a huge fan of coconut ice cream all around. I'm such a sucker for them :/Buttermilk is my boyfriends fave, I wasn't a huge fan.Avocado tasted pretty citrus-y and not so avocado smoothie style that I grew up drinking as an Asian kid. This took me as a surprise and don't think I'll be ordering it again.It's a quaint place deep in the heights that's worth a try! I love that they make their Popsicles the same day in a beautiful kitchen that is in an open space for customers to see. Plus they use all organic and locally grown fruits for their ingredients. They are pretty pricey pops, but anything to support organic foods! The pops also didn't make me feel bloated or fat haha it digested very easily and I was ready to eat another. Based on just the pops, I would rate this place a 3 but it gets 1 extra star because of their awesome mission and fantastic customer service. Even though 1 of the three pops that I've tasted were imo ""good"", I still think this place is worth a visit! Did I mention that they have the best insulated to-go bags I've ever ordered?? I can't wait to come back for more creamy pops to review."
1361,11/5/2016,Susana g.,houston,3,I think the popsicles are ok. I didn't taste anything that was outstanding. I would prefer to buy popsicles from a paletero same flavors and cheaper.
1362,7/27/2016,Jordan W.,houston,5,"I've never tried Popsicles other than the ones I buy at the grocery store. This shop is located in the Heights, and I was really impressed to find a dessert place in this area. There were lots of good flavored Popsicles to try.I had the orange flavor one and it was really good. My friend had the vanilla bean, which I think was the winner of our group. It had good vanilla flavor, and a very rich taste. Even though these Popsicles are about $3 a piece, they're really fancy and the area is very spread out for different restaurants. I really enjoyed trying this place, and will come back here for dessert one day."
1363,7/9/2016,Ann L.,houston,5,"Never heard of this chain before but wow it is great! They have organic and delicious unique flavors! For only $3 a pop! They also sell bags if u wanna take some on the go! I tried the strawberry shortcake and the champagne white tea. Both were soo good! But i would have to say that the strawberry shortcake (which was a cookie pop) was like 70% cookie and i didn't know that so it just crumbled all over me just fyi!!!! It was still good if you like cookies hahha. And the champagne white tea was so sweet and unique! I think I want to try that one again! My boyfriend got peach and coconut. His peach Popsicle had little prices of peach in it, it was very refreshing! We loved this place and want to try all the flavors haha also this was a great place and customer service was very helpful and great!"
1364,4/6/2017,R M.,houston,5,Great selection of vegan fruit pops. Website lists all ingredients and nutrition statements. So tasty and refreshing on a hot Houston day!
1365,7/16/2017,Kevyn S.,houston,3,The popsicles are good and full with rich flavor. I like the atmosphere of the establishment. I thought the customer service was not so great. I made a few mistakes when ordering and the employee gave me a weird face every time I messed up. I felt mistreated. The popsicles are great and I recommend everyone try it.
1366,9/17/2016,Maria C.,houston,5,"I fell in love with this place, best pops in town specially Thai latte..."
1367,2/20/2017,Andrea P.,houston,5,"Love this place! It's so hard to pick a flavor because they make so many great combinations! Every time I go, I'm not let down by my choice. Wish they had more locations."
1368,9/6/2016,Stephen M.,houston,5,GREAT IDEA!  Amazing choices!  The fruit pops rock and the cream pops are seriously amazing!
1369,7/2/2016,Brent M.,houston,5,"So my awesome wife says lets get in the car and go get a Popsicle, 90+ degrees outside so I say sure lets go. Thinking we're going to Kroger for some box stuff. Of course that is not the case, we end up at Steel City Pops, I'm thinking how on earth can a storefront stay open just selling Popsicles. But I enter the very cool looking place, greeted by a very friendly staff and a huge assortment of popsicles. I try the buttermilk, it's gone in 2 minutes, I'm hooked, for some crazy reason I order a second, a chocolate, it too disappears in 2 minutes. Needless to say, this place is fantastic, as in holy sheet these are good."
1370,3/28/2017,Marco L.,houston,5,I like their selection of frozen popsicles.  My kids love them. They have been a good experience so we go often to the place in Houston.  I'm yet to try the one in Dallas in lower Greenville.
1371,9/6/2016,Mm K.,houston,3,"Drove out to visit this spot since it seemed to go hand in hand with Houston summers... we ordered the 4 pack which is a little cheaper vs ordering 4 separate popsicles. Although they have some ""weird"" flavors, I was expecting more.The popsicles were just that, popsicles. It wasn't mind blowing but it was good to experience.A lot of us opted for the fruity flavors which were okay but I got a bite of a friend's creamy and I would probably opt for that the next time around we may be in the area. It's not anything we'd drive out to for awhile though.The best thing there was the staff that helped us, I wish I had gotten his name. He was very enthusiastic and didn't hesitate to help us first timers out - even offered that if we didn't like any of the flavors he suggested, he'd gladly let us swap it out."
1372,3/19/2017,Charlene F.,houston,5,They have both dairy and non-dairy options which is ideal for our family. I suggest not getting too attached to a specific flavor since they do rotate. There also isn't a ton of seating. The popsicles are delicious though! You can also order to go pops!
1373,7/12/2016,Kim H.,houston,4,"Houston can't have enough cold refreshing desserts!  It was pretty packed when we went on a hot Saturday afternoon.  Service was really great, very patient and willing to answer questions. I tried the all fruit pops - watermelon.  It was way too sweet for my taste buds but I do tend to like lighter snacks.  It was not as refreshing as I had hoped for and I think it was because of the added sugar.  My bf got the blood orange which was also sweet and slightly sour (citrus) but more refreshing than the watermelon. It was kind of nice to see the kitchen area where they make the pops, they seem to use really fresh and REAL ingredients.  I will be back.. hopefully to try something less sugary sweet."
1374,2/26/2017,Tanya A.,houston,4,"First time here, loved their popcicles the only thing was the service I wasn't sure about flavors but the guy there didn't seem to want to help...."
1375,9/10/2016,Ell B.,houston,5,"I admit I have never been to the location itself, but Steel City gave my workplace a sampler to promote their product and presence now in Houston. They were so delicious! The mango one and the jalapeño something-or-other (pineapple?) were both way more delicious and creative than any pop I've ever eaten elsewhere. In Fort Worth, I tried the strawberry balsamic once. Hope they are rocking that in Houston too."
1376,7/5/2016,Paulyne D.,houston,5,"If you haven't been, you need to come. These are some of the most amazing Popsicles ever! I went to their soft opening before the actual opening because of a close friend who works there and these were the ratings of the pops I got to try out:Coconut: 5/5 is my favorite pop from them ever but that's cause I love tropical flavors! Strawberry cheesecake: 5/5 there's a cookie crust inside and I literally died Vanilla cookie: 4/5 kind of heavy but if you love cookies and ice cream this is gonna be your faveAvocado: 4/5 has a kick of sour from maybe like I assume? It was still very creamy and yummy!White tea: 3/5 I can't remember the entire name but I know it was refreshing but I'm more of a creamy ice cream type of personStrawberry lemonade: 4/5 definitely one of the most light yet flavorful lemonade based pops they have. It's not to sour but it's also not to sweet!Anyways, I love the atmosphere and how open the place is and the staff seems so energetic and happy it's great for family and friends! Definitely worth the try!"
1377,1/1/2017,Napat P.,houston,5,I absolutely love this place. They have almost 20 flavors of pops and they vary each day. These includes fruity and creamy options as well as cookie pops. There's no table but they provide space so that you can your treats at the store after purchase. I first got the lemon cream pop and later decided to get 4 pops bag to-go. They have interesting flavors like black sesame and satsuma (orange) cream flavors. Too bad strawberry short cake was not the menu at the time I visited but I will definitely be back to try more!!!
1378,8/27/2016,RW A.,houston,5,"The best Popsicles you will ever have! Very happy they came to Houston! Tried the horchata and strawberry shortcake, both were fantastic."
1379,12/12/2016,Kristi P.,houston,5,"I very much enjoyed the strawberry lemonade pop. I will be back to try some of the other flavors they have. Another plus in my book, they are pet  friendly."
1380,12/7/2016,Mimi D.,houston,5,"I'm kind of obsessed with this place. I go in at least once a week. Their flavors change weekly, if not daily, but my favorite has been the strawberry shortcake ( when/ if they have it). They also have a punch card as their reward system."
1381,12/14/2016,Jennifer V.,houston,5,Great little shop! Very popular among our friends. We can't get enough of this place during the summer and fall!
1382,1/16/2017,Marinel A.,houston,5,Awesome popsicles! Offers a variety of classic and unique flavors. Friendly and warm atmosphere. This will definitely be our new go to afternoon treat!
1383,8/29/2016,Diane N.,houston,3,"A little pricey for just a pop, but I know i'm paying for the heights location and the novelty flavor popsicles. I really liked the horchata flavor, but I thought the mango was just ok. I felt like I could a better refreshing mango pop for cheaper. I'd rather just get a mangonada or go to the grocery store to get organic or local made popsicles."
1384,2/1/2017,Kristine C.,houston,5,Very relaxed atmosphere--went on a Sunday afternoon. Pomegranate pop was yummy.  We brought our dog and hung out and played ping pong.  Fun place!
1385,11/17/2016,Sade G.,houston,5,"so far I've only had one pop from my 4 pack... so based on my buttered pecan pop OMG it was so good this may be my favorite flavor here so creamy just enough sweet just enough salt and the BIG pieces of pecan at the bottom so good, I can't wait to try my 3 other flavors (vanilla bean, strawberry lemonade & strawberry mint I think it's called). I will be back for the buttered pecan MORE MORE MORE. The lady was super nice and helpful in me picking out flavors. Paid 11.00 for the 4 pack."
1386,11/30/2016,Tuyet V.,houston,5,"Was in Houston for three days. Went here 2/3 days. I'm a fruit person, so my favorite was the strawberry lemonade. Service is great and so is the atmosphere."
1387,4/19/2017,Nick R.,houston,5,"Went to a car function where there was a small set up and was really amazed at how good these popsicles were. A few weeks later I decided to venture all the way out to the heights to check out the rest of the selection and the actual store front. I live near sugar land so it was pretty far ""just for popsicles"". Once I got there I was greeted by friendly faces, they were very patient as I decided what I wanted, I ended up with the coconut and it was probably the best popsicle I have ever had in my life (not exaggerating). My friend had the avocado and he agreed it was one of the best popsicles he's had before. We sat and hung out for a little bit and enjoyed our popsicles, in the 5-10 mins we were there the store pretty much filled up with 20-25 people. Everything ran smoothly everyone was out fairly quickly. Next time I come in I will try something else that I feel i can get dipped and topped. While we were there i noticed that they have to go ""packs"". I asked if it would hold up all the way to sugar land (45 mins away), the guy behind the counter (I forgot his name unfortunately) said it would be good for about an hour give or take. The 12 pack is a styrofoam cooler with an ice pack. We hit a lot of traffic in the way back and stretched it out slightly over an hr and the popsicles were still good with no signs of melting when I got them into the freezer. Def will come back."
1388,11/21/2016,Gregory W.,houston,5,"Amazing popsicles for $3 each. I take people here pretty often, and while it looks a sounds a little silly to go get artisan popsicles, I've been very happy everytime we go."
1389,11/20/2016,Bert S.,houston,4,"Eating these little treats brings out the kid in me. I had the strawberry lemonade and it was so good that after I ate it i was licking the stick and thinking of going back to get another one. I also try the hibiscus, that one was just okay. Next time, I am getting 2 strawberry lemonades and maybe try out the marshmallow, i saw someone else with that one and it looked interesting."
1390,11/27/2016,Adam B.,houston,4,Pops are good as long as you don't remember how expensive they are.
1391,8/7/2016,Michael T.,houston,3,"These are really good but very expensive, they are very similar to the Mexican paletas which run about 1 $ each.They taste basically the same, but select city pops dose have more exotic flavors and 33$ per dozen is outrageous."
1392,12/27/2016,Kid A.,houston,5,Steel City is so good.  I love the strawberry lemonade and my mom likes vanilla bean.
1393,10/28/2016,Penny G.,houston,5,"Tasty popsicles with cool flavors, nice/hipster setting friendly for kids, families, and dessert dates."
1394,12/20/2016,Maria Q.,houston,4,In love I mean in love with the food here amazing. So happy my bestie introduced me here. To keep it short the staff Is nice and friendly and like other reviews say that's just the icing on the cupcake. Definitely have became a lifetime customer love you guys
1395,5/13/2017,Aaron T.,houston,5,"This place completely changes the concept of popsicles. You will never go back to the shady trucks or grocery stores for pops. Concept straight from the heart of Birmingham, Alabama (look at the skyline mural). You have to try it."
1396,11/12/2016,Meg D.,houston,5,Yum! Fun and quick for a little pick-me-up. My friend recognized them since she had this place in Birmingham. Definitely can't wait to go back.
1397,10/2/2016,Han N.,houston,4,"I'm not a hipster so I'm not sure if my review will go over well w/ said people.. j/k! I enjoyed my first experience at Steel City Pops. There was a short line but very quick and friendly service. I came on the first day of October so the Fall flavors were introduced and the Summer flavors were on sale! I got a Orange mint green tea pop (Fall) and bf got the Mango (Summer). I enjoyed mine and the best part is that the pop remains so frozen--  No icky mess! This place is huge which is surprising since rent in the Heights is so pricey! The 2 pops were $4 and $3, respectively. There is a ping pong table but such a long wait so I enjoyed my Popsicle at the bar facing the window. I would def stop by again if ever in the area but would not drive out of my way for these, unfortunately."
1398,12/4/2016,Nina P.,houston,5,"Great snack or dessert option on a hot summer day (which is most of the year in Houston:). They have a nice selection of fruity and creamy flavors to appease everyone's taste buds. Flavors change with the season so there's always new pop options to go back for! This is a good place for children and adults as their menu caters to both. There's definitely flavors that are appealing to kids (strawberry lemonade, chocolate, vanilla, orange, etc.) and ones that are more adventurous for adults (plum with rosemary, eggnog, rum raisin). Wonderful place for the family! Love it and think you'll come often? Grab one of their loyalty cards for perks!"
1399,7/17/2016,El H.,houston,4,"Fruity and creamy Popsicles! ~$4 each and ready-to-go for Houston summers. Plenty of space and parking. Cool alternative to all the ice cream shops. Recommend: Mango, coconut, and coffee!"
1400,8/26/2016,Ashley D.,houston,5,"Everyone was happy. Blueberry basil was delicious for mom, simple watermelon was great for kiddo (even though I stole some too!). Plus, The ping-pong table and added even more fun to a sunny afternoon."
1401,8/1/2016,Namrata S.,houston,4,"What a great place! fast service, great, funny, friendly people working there.  It was my first time there- I had heard about it from friends in Dallas, I got the strawberry lemonade pop based on an employee rec- it was so good! I would like to come back to try the other unique flavors like avacado and chai latte.  There is a great a/c side room with plenty of room for people to walk around in, very convenient.  parking lot as well."
1402,11/20/2016,Rachel W.,houston,5,"Excellent location, great atmosphere, fun decor (love the succulents out front), friendly and knowledgeable staff, and the popsicles are awesome! I had the plum/rosemary the other day. Perfect combo. I can't wait to come back and try more flavors!"
1403,11/16/2016,Kelin W.,houston,5,"My children and I love Steel City Pops! The popsicles are sweet without being over the top and every flavor is excellent! My favorite is the avocado, which is unfortunately seasonal but very rich and delicious. Probably my favorite thing about the location is the closed patio which is usually full of children running around like animals which is a big hit with my kids!"
1404,10/10/2016,Ronald S.,houston,5,"We went to this place with our friends and it reminded me of a popsicle place we went to in Columbia. Freshly made pops, all of them are delicious. It's a must try place."
1405,4/17/2017,Jenny L.,houston,4,Great flavors! Love the black sesame.  The fruity ones are light and refreshing. The creamy ones are rich and yummy. Delicious though a little pricey.
1406,11/26/2016,Ricky J.,houston,5,"I went to a location in Ft. Worth once and was extremely excited when I found out that they had opened a location in Houston!The toasted marshmallow popsicle was the one I got this time around and it was perfect. Highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a delicious dessert! Be sure you ask them for one of their Frequent Buyer Cards. Buy 10, get the 11th one free!"
1407,10/15/2016,Alecia Danielle H.,houston,5,This place is amazing. Their popsicles are the best especially the creamy ones. The cookies and cream one is incredible! Everything I have had is awesome. Great atmosphere too. I recommend going and giving this place a try. 5 stars!!!
1408,9/27/2016,Jen F.,houston,5,I love their pops!! I have tried almost all of the fruity ones. My favorite are blood orange and strawberry lemonade. I like getting the 4 pop bag and they have an awesome loyalty program!
1409,8/18/2016,S M.,houston,5,"Great flavors - the standards done really well (chocolate is really good) and then the interesting to keep you, well, interested. Great space - lots of room for kids and groups. Very glad they are in the heights!"
1410,10/10/2016,Valencia C.,houston,5,Yummy in the tummy...I really like this place. I ordered the banana pudding pop and it was delicious
1411,11/2/2016,EJ J.,houston,4,"love this place. I'm from Dallas, so I'm so glad Houston now has one! the popsicles were SO GOOD!... I got in line.... twice bc after my first pop, I kind of needed another one! I got the sweet tea, then the blood orange. My 5 month old daughter was lucky enough to get a taste of my sweet tea pop and she loved it! the only thing I don't like is the packed crowds, which come and go in waves, and the lack of tables & seating, BUT this is the heights which is now over flooded with young families and hipsters so it is what it is. Will be returning for sure!"
1412,7/10/2016,Thomas D.,houston,5,"I came on Grand Opening day, and I was immediately greeted by the staff. The atmosphere of the place was very nice! It was a clean & industrial kind of vibe. They had a great selection of Popsicle flavors, from fruity to creamy flavors! The champagne flavored Popsicle was my favorite! Each Popsicle is $3, and it's good to know that they have freezer bags so you can bring home these tasty treats w/o it melting otw home!"
1413,9/10/2016,Madison M.,houston,5,"I loved this place when I first had it at the Magnolia Market in Waco, and I was so excited when I found out they were opening in the Heights. It fits in perfectly with the aesthetic! I HIGHLY recommend this wonderful place!!"
1414,10/11/2016,Ericka G.,houston,5,The Pineapple Jalapeno was seriously awesome....a nice spicy sweet taste that I've never had before! Deliciousness!
1415,9/11/2016,Angie J.,houston,5,"This place is perfect for the summer. I got the coconut (creamy) flavored. It was very tasty with some bits of coconut flakes at the end. There is a ping pong area but limited traditional seating. There are mostly stools along the perimeter bar area. We'll definitely be back. Bonus: if you order pops to go, they can keep them at the counter until you're ready to leave. They also offer free cold packs. Very important in the Houston heat!!!"
1416,8/7/2016,Sarah P.,houston,5,Worth every penny. Best dessert without breaking the calorie bank. Love all of them! Piña colada is the only one I didn't like because I do not like the drink
1417,8/5/2016,Caylin R.,houston,5,This place is incredibly tasty! The Sweet tea one is my absolute favorite. If you ever need to cool down on a day especially here in Houston this is the place to go. They're pretty cheap for a Popsicle compared to others. Love it love it love it!
1418,8/21/2016,Lee L.,houston,5,Got a cookie n cream and a buttermilk Popsicles. Buttermilk tasted like a perfect frozen pie. CnC taste awesome. Go there. Be amazed. Nice staff!
1419,8/3/2016,Tiffany L.,houston,5,"My first time going here was the one in Dallas so when I heard they just opened one in Houston I knew I had to try it. It's just as amazing as the one up in Dallas! I just wish it wasn't so far for me,  if it was closer I would be going there almost every day!!"
1420,8/19/2016,Michelle O.,houston,5,Truly delicious fancy ice pops!! Great for my kids and I. We walked over from a friends house and enjoyed sitting in the indoor area without worrying about the ice melting everywhere . How do they not melt instantly ?! I barely even had to clean up the kids after ! Win for me!
1421,8/2/2016,Samantha J.,houston,5,I loved this place. Went on a Sunday the wait wasnt long even though  there were alot of people. Bought 12 pops for $33 and got them in a box. Everyone who we bought them for loved them. I tried the pineapple jalapeno which  was delicious. Recommend this place and pops are only $3 which i think is reasonable.
1422,2/16/2017,G K.,houston,5,"Great popsicle place. We had coffee, chocolate, strawberry,  & banana. Friendly and good for kids."
1423,8/28/2016,Jessica P.,houston,5,"Two questions for the owners: Where did you come from?! And how can you make popsicles so delicious?!Two comments for people reading Yelp reviews: If you are on the fence because you like ice cream or other desserts - for the love of all that is good - give this place a shot! It will surprise you. (How?! How can they make them so delicious? I seriously don't understand...)For people who are planning a date, here is my advice: go out to one of the nearby Thai places in the Heights are and get some spicy food. Follow it up by cooling your palette with one of these Steel City treats (and try to have a conversation without innuendoes... good luck!) My favorites: Chai, cantaloupe and coconut (but I don't think you can go wrong with any of them)."
1424,7/9/2016,Khai H.,houston,4,"Big space nice place, great pops!  My kid loves it.  the avocado pop was very creamy and good"
1425,7/20/2016,Martin J.,houston,5,"Great place to come hang out with friends and family to beat the heat! Interior looked awesome and had lots of space.  Not many places to sir down, but it's not like your eating dinner anyway. We tried the coffee, avocado, chocolate, berry/basil. All were amazing. Can't wait to try the rest."
1426,7/15/2016,Caire C.,houston,5,"OMG the Popsicles are amazing! I had the strawberry shortcake, it had a shortbread cookie in the middle to make it taste just like the cake! My friend had the sweet tea & it was delicious, tastes just like sweet tea. My sister had strawberry lemonade and it was very refreshing! I will definitely be back! Nice atmosphere."
1427,8/12/2016,sophia c.,houston,5,Great pops! Super friendly staff! Had the horchata which tastes exactly like the arroz con leche paletas your paletero sells minus the chunky rice bits. The caramel one is rich and and holds a very strong caramel flavor. Check it out if you get the chance.
1428,8/9/2016,David P.,houston,4,"Made our first (and definitely not last) visit to Steel City Pops on a Sunday Afternoon around 4:30pm.  We walked inside and were greeted with a friendly smile.  Since it was our first trip, we had to look at the menu to decide what we wanted.  My wife ordered the Pineapple Jalapeno, while I got the blueberry basil.  The popsicles were very reasonably priced, tasted great and we were in and out within 2 minutes of walking in.  My only suggestion would be to add a bit more seating.  Since all of the tables were taken in the front, we had to eat our popsicles in the car.  Outdoor seating would be GREAT for those cooler months in the spring and fall!"
1429,7/18/2016,Sean H.,houston,5,"I love this place! When  the family and I travel to Fort Worth, we always have to stop and get popsicles. We were so excited to hear that one opened in Houston. We had a great time. I had the strawberry lemonade (personal favorite) and my wife had strawberry shortcake. The staff was very nice and quick. The inside is nice with a lot of room for a large amount of folks. Make sure you bring a cooler with you to stock up on some for home."
1430,8/4/2016,Tiffany B.,houston,5,"The pops here are great! Try the buttermilk (tastes like cheesecake!). Oh, and the passionfruit...hell, try them all!"
1431,8/19/2016,Kia C. I.,houston,5,"Just amazing! I visited this place with my boss this week & we bought pops for the whole firm. The flavors are innovative & fresh! The service was great- smiles are always what I like to see when there is an exchange of money & these ladies at the counter were cheerful & knowledgable. I love the fact that they have a play room for kids & animals so Popsicles can be eaten and wasted somewhere other than your car or in a nice place in the vicinity that makes you embarrassed to be the parent of the messy kid, you know? Great concept & great service with multiple delicious choices!"
1432,7/26/2016,Felix M.,houston,5,"Great way to beat the heat on Houston, large sized pops for a decent price. The only thing I could say needed improvement is more seating in the open room, but that doesn't effect the quality of the actual pops themselves so I'm still leaving s 5 star."
1433,7/6/2016,B G.,houston,3,"While I didn't particularly enjoy the lavender lemonade because I didn't smell or taste any lavender and the lemon was overwhelming and bitter (even for me as a lemon lover), I appreciate that they use fresh, natural ingredients. My spouse got the strawberry lemonade and loved it so next time I'll get a different flavor. Glad to have a refreshing treat in the area."
1434,7/3/2016,Anjana V.,houston,5,"Yummmmmmm!!! Heard a lot about this place and tried it out today. Creamy and fruity Popsicles. We tried the creamy variety, chocolate and peach strawberry and they were both delicious! Not overly sweet, perfectly flavored, and refreshing! Friendly, cheerful staff to greet us. We look forward to going back and trying out all the other flavors!"
1435,12/2/2016,Marcia R.,houston,5,"This place is my family's new favorite spot to go.  The Popsicle are delicious and the flavors they offer range from unique flavors for the adventurous eater to old school.  Additionally, there is an awesome space for the kids to enjoy your Popsicle and play.  Every time we go, my kids make new friends and we see someone we know.  Great addition to the neighborhood!"
1436,9/7/2016,Michelle C.,houston,4,Nice hot weather dessert addition to the Heights!  Nice patio to let your kids run around like crazies after their sugar fix.  Mango and Blueberry Basil are great flavors.
1437,9/25/2016,Nicole F.,houston,5,Really fun place!  I'm not normally into popcycles so had no expectations of really liking it but it's totally not like normal pops that we grew up eating. There are so many flavors to choose from. The creamy pops and the pops with the cookie/cake in the middle were fabulous. They have a dry ice to-go box so you can take a dozen home for your own freezer!
1438,7/8/2016,Paula W.,houston,5,"Really good!  Had a lavender lemonade and a peach.  All of the fruit flavors are less than ~100 calories and the creamy flavors are up to 200.  The peach was full of fresh peaches... not concentrate peaches or canned peaches, fresh peaches and you could see bits of peach skin in the popsicle.  So good!  The lemonade was also super refreshing on a hot Houston day.  I highly recommend this place for a fresh healthy treat that isn't full of corn syrup and fake ingredients.  The service is quick too since all they have to do is hand you a popsicle and they don't have to make anything.  I also love that it is in a renovated old building and they didn't just tear it down to build something cheap and new."
1439,9/3/2016,Lisa T.,houston,5,Really fantastic  Prewrapped popsicles clearly homemade  they tell you how many calories and some we excellent and surprisingly low cal.  I had the Mocha and it was excellent the blood orange is also very very good!!!  Highly recommend.
1440,8/13/2016,Hector A.,houston,5,The pops were delicious. Try the pineapple jalapeño one. The perfect spot for these hot summer days.
1441,7/25/2016,Khanh H.,houston,5,"Awesome place!  So good and refreshing ... Perfect for the hot summer days.  It is a little pricey for a pop, but they are really delicious and taste like all fresh ingredients.  Their space is spacious, nice and clean so it makes up for it.  Buy a 4 pack to save!  Or even better 33!  If they had one by uptown post oak, i would go more often."
1442,8/26/2016,j m.,houston,3,"They're just Popsicles, expensive Popsicles. I wasn't totally wowed, but it was nice not to make them myself for a change. We had chocolate, lime, and the strawberry. It was a nice outgoing and we enjoyed the indoor patio. They get 3 stars for a cool concept/set up and 2 stars taken off because if you want me to pay $3 for a Popsicle it needs to taste better than mine."
1443,7/22/2016,Katelyn M.,houston,5,So great! Love having them in the neighborhood. I've only tried the fruity kind but it was a great summer treat.
1444,7/2/2016,Elizabeth D.,houston,5,"I'm from Birmingham where Steel City Pops is from, and these are hands down the best Popsicles. So happy they finally opened this Houston location, they did a great job! It would be a cool spot for events as well."
1445,7/12/2016,Laura H.,houston,5,"Really great Popsicles! I have had the coconut, peach, strawberry lemonade and blood orange. My favorite was the strawberry lemonade because it was the perfect balance of sweet and tart! The coconut was a bit too sweet for my taste but the flavor was delicious--kind of like a caramel delight girl scout cookie. The peach was very refreshing and the blood orange was nice too! I want to try blackberry and watermelon next! Overall a really nice place to cool down!"
1446,7/9/2016,Katherine T.,houston,5,"Delicious and a great alternative to ice cream. We had the coconut, coffee and chocolate and all were amazing."
1447,7/26/2016,Vanessa B.,houston,5,"Heaven in my mouth! Vegan friendly and gluten-free pops. Customer service is great, place is clean and the ice cream pops are delicious. Great place for a quick sugar fix."
1448,9/16/2017,Jerry S.,waco,5,Cool concept (pun intended). We liked it so much we went twice in one day. I had the oatmeal pie (unbelievable!) & then coffee dipped in dark chocolate with caramel and sea salt. They a bunch of different flavors and calories vary (if you care about that kind of thing - between 80 to 400). I definitely recommend this place...enjoy!
1449,7/21/2017,Dwayne O.,waco,4,"Popsicles, fruit or other flavors, tried the Strawberry Cream, Peach Cream and Cookies and Cream. Liked the Strawberry Cream and  Cookies and Cream more. Can get them dipped or add other items to it.Not too much seating and place is really small"
1450,8/18/2017,Jerry P.,waco,5,"Gourmet popsicles, so good. Service is fast but there's not much space inside. Still, great concept, highly recommend"
1451,8/30/2017,Robin A.,waco,4,This place was so good! I had the Vanilla Bean Ice Cream pop and it tasted just like a Starbucks Vanilla Bean Frap. I highly recommend this place. I think its a great place for people of all ages! Husband had the root beer pop and he was going to town on it so im sure it was just as amazing lol
1452,8/12/2017,Cody L.,fort-worth,5,"Soooo good!!! Especially on a warm, warmer or hot day!these cool and refreshing treats come in so many all natural flavors. They can be dipped, drizzled or dusted in various toppings to give your tastebuds a ride. I'm not a huge ice cream lover... but these fancy popsicle are delicious. Creamy or fruity you just can't go wrong. And because they have excellent customer service, if you don't like a flavor, they will trade you a different one for free, so choose without fear!The whole family loves this place..."
1453,8/12/2017,Karana H.,fort-worth,3,"I do like their pops, but this location really really stinks - that's why I deducted 2 stars. If you live close by and can walk here, great. But parking just to get a popiscle here is not worth the trouble. They do not validate parking, so if you park in the nearby garages -- be careful! I've been hearing about how the garage owners will tow you (there are spotters watching -- creepy) if you don't visit one of their approved list of retailers first, which Steel City is not, as of this review. And street parking? Pffft...good luck!Once you get parking out of the way, then there's the long lines outside, and very cramp inside. Alot of people don't know what they want, so they hem and haw at the counter holding up the line. Maybe they should consider: (1) posting the menu outside so people can ponder out of the way of other customers who just want to do a quick in and out or (2) a popsicle vending machine like how Sprinkles does with their cupcakes. Purchasing a popsicle should be quick and easy, this place just gives me anxiety!"
1454,6/24/2017,Emily W.,fort-worth,5,"Highly recommended on a hot day... but watch out - they'll melt fast outside!The root beer and raspberry lemon were delicious, although there was definitely some tang to the raspberry lemon! The popsicles are $3 but are humongous. Inside, you can sit on bar stools and watch them make batches of the pops, which is awesome!"
1455,5/10/2017,Hazel P.,fort-worth,4,"Who knew you could love popsicles so much! I of course have fond memories of this icy treat as a child, but not the way Steel City does pops! It's a small building located just outside of the West 7th shopping district. The building may be small, but you won't miss their name in large steel letters, boldly illuminated at night! Very eye catching, I dig it.Make sure if you decide to park in the parking garage, that you plan on spending some amount of dollars in the actual West 7th shopping because sadly, Steel City isn't able to validate your parking.When you go in, everything is laid out in a pretty easy to understand format. They have flavors on the menu above the register and your customization options listed next to it.The gist is: you pick your flavor, choose between (or combine) dipping, drizzling, dredging, or dusting your pop in various sauces and toppings. I can always get behind a fun concept, and I'veNever been anywhere that has this concept with ice pops as opposed to ice creams.They have an awesome array of flavors from fresh and fruity to creamy and decadent. Jon G. knew what he wanted before I did, a coffee pop with a chocolate drizzle. I really had a hard time picking, but finally decided on the Elderflower pop, dipped in white chocolate and dredged with pistachios. I'm a big admirer of floral flavors, so when I read it on the menu, I knew I had to get it! When I imagine what dredging something looks like, I think of when you dredge chicken in flour and breadcrumbs before you fry it. You take the piece and submerge, coat, toss etc. until it's completely covered. Sadly, this wasn't how my pop came. It was nicely dipped in white chocolate, but was only laid atop a little pile of pistachios, with another sprinkling on top. Although it wasn't necessarily what I had imagined, taste-wise, nothing was compromised. I just had to scoop up the extra pistachios with my fingers or with the popsicle itself.The price was right, staff was polite and quick, experience was positive and the pops were definitely memorable! Solid win for Steel City!"
1456,9/26/2017,Emma H.,fort-worth,2,"My friends and I wanted to see what was all the hype about. Disappointed because it wasn't anything special. Cool feel and decorations to the place, but overall taste was average."
1457,8/25/2017,Reba G.,fort-worth,4,"I'm so relieved there isn't one located near me.  Haha!  My sister took me here, and we both got the cookies and cream popsicle.  I didn't know what to expect,  but it was GREATNESS.   They make all their popsicles in house,  and they also have odd combinations that you can try.  I'll have to come back when I'm in the area."
1458,7/2/2017,Danielle T.,fort-worth,3,"I've been hearing people rave about this place for a while now, and I finally got to check it out. I ordered the strawberries and cream dipped in milk chocolate. I thought it was pretty good.... it took a while to finish even in the hot sun, so it's pretty perfect for walking around. I did not care for the patio set up outside, there was hardly any shade and limited seating.... no ambience. I don't think I'll be back unless I'm in the neighborhood and really have a sweet tooth."
1459,8/30/2017,Nicole C.,fort-worth,5,"My first ever Steel City Pop was brought to work. A friend brought one back for me at the office from a lunch outing. I think it was the Hibiscus flavor and it was excellent! I loved the flavor and still do. Since then (a few years ago) I've been to both the FW location and most recently, the were the treat of a summer social at my current job. We got to choose from 4 flavors (strawberry lemonade, raspberry lemonade, chocolate & coconut). I got the chocolate! My first non-fruity pop from Steel City. These pops make for great, cold summer snack for all ages!"
1460,8/8/2017,Kimberly Y.,fort-worth,5,"Lots of unique flavors and seasonal flavors.  I got the jalapeño pineapple which I really enjoyed, but hubby didn't.  My kids aren't very adventurous when it comes to flavors and textures, so they didn't enjoy the popsicles as much as I did.  The popsicles are also very pricey, so we probably won't frequent this establishment only because we are a family of 6 and it's not ideal to spend so much on popsicles my kids won't eat.  However, if mommy ever gets to go on her own, I'd definitely stop by to try whatever new flavor is available.  I highly recommend to try this place out!"
1461,1/18/2017,Hazel V.,fort-worth,4,"I saw this place on Instagram and really wanted to try it --- their unique flavors lured me in!1) This isn't IN Sundance Square. There's a cart they have apparently but I didn't run into it while I was there.... this is actually further down close by. Close by to drive, not to walk. I mean you can try but it's a bit a way aways. 2) It's in a really cute plaza on its own! The lights make it so much more inviting at night!We got here pretty early in the night on a Sunday I think and it was empty! Whoo! Take ALL THE TIME to decide!I tried to play it safe and got the Blood Orange pop, I was actually overwhelmed with the options I didn't get anything on it. I'm sobbing as I write this because I wish I had! The fruit pops are a little tough to bite into but they are extremely flavorful! They aren't the type of fruit pops where you can suck the juice out of them and you're just left with a stick of ice (you know what I'm talking about) they seem like they're literally completely made of fruit juice, which is nice. A little bit... filing. My boyfriend got the Gingerbread Cookie Pop and OMG. OMG.OMG.Can we talk about this for a minute?It's milk based but it was like... cinnamon ice cream with a wonderful sweet gingerbread cookie slapped in the middle. It was SO good. We didn't get it dipped or anything either since it was our first time here and it was heavenly on it's own. We were actually kinda fighting over that one.I can't wait to see what seasonal flavors they'll have when I come back next month but I hear they have a Lemon Cake pop or something? I don't know but I'm psyched! And I'm definitely dipping my pop this time!"
1462,11/12/2016,Sarah W.,fort-worth,4,"I've always been a fan of steel city. This is a solid choice in Fort Worth and definitely a ""must have"".  I've never had a bad flavor choice here. The parking situation is horrible, and they don't validate your parking garage ticket. Although their parking lot only fits 6 cars. The line inside is very cramped and the outside seating is not ideal in rally hot or cold weather. Overall quality of popsicles is top notch though."
1463,7/9/2017,Jessica D.,fort-worth,3,"Went here expecting great things due to all the reviews and it was just ok.  I got the cookies and cream pop, it was ok, cookie wasn't very good.  The inside was very tiny and crowded, and I couldn't get a cup of water, instead it was $2.  They didn't have their own parking.  The only thing I liked was the games and tables outside and the unique concept."
1464,11/16/2016,Christine B.,fort-worth,4,My absolute favorite pop shop! So many freaking options!!! I ended up getting the strawberry and fig pop. I wish they opened on in NYC! Make sure to pick up a punch card!
1465,4/22/2017,Jorge O.,fort-worth,4,Closest thing to paletero paleta (the bell ringing street vendor selling popsicles for the non-español speakers)The fruit pops are delicious and not overly sweet. Small establishment but has an outside area as well. Staff are super friendly.
1466,4/16/2017,Carl B.,fort-worth,3,"Cool concept and menu, mixed execution.Our group of 6 ordered and then waited and waited, as other parties after us got their pops first. When we asked about it, we were brusquely told our pops were coming, and it was busy -- we could see it was busy and also see that their system had failed us. Part of what slowed things down is they don't take your name, so even though we paid together, they had to call out each pop by type, and it took us a minute to remember what we'd ordered, it had been so long.Once we got the pops, we mostly enjoyed them, though a few -- peanut butter, avocado -- didn't feature much of the featured taste.Kind of crowded, awkward seating inside."
1467,7/28/2017,Terry E.,fort-worth,4,Great product and lots of choices of flavors. Stays solid and doesn't melt down your arm. Friendly staff. Limited ordering and inside seating area; outside seating is hot in summer. No parking lot; have to park down the block.
1468,5/29/2017,Sharon K.,fort-worth,3,"This place seems popular but I just found it average. It was somewhat busy on Memorial Day. I lined up to a somewhat awkward setup; you walk in to be immediately faced with the cashier so the line forms out the door right off the bat. There's a line of freezers to the left of the cashier that holds all the popsicles and the menus on the wall are also aligned to the left of the cashier. The line shifted to the left, along the freezers, so we wouldn't be blocking the doors. I expected someone to come over and take our order but she stayed put right behind the cash register and asked what I wanted, only moving to get my order. I knew they could add toppings but the girl didn't bother asking so I just paid for my pre-packaged popsicle and walked out. I got sweet tea and it tasted good but the below average customer service, $3 price for an average popsicle, and shortage of easy/free parking makes me think this place is overrated. If you're out here already and want to stop for a treat, great. If you're a foodie on a hunt, don't bother."
1469,1/25/2017,JessicaLea C.,fort-worth,5,I had a stawberry lemonade pop at the stockshow today. It was deliciously sweet and tart at the same time! I was so happy to see the little Steel City Pops cart!
1470,9/4/2017,Tracie Q.,fort-worth,5,"Expensive, but delicious! A nice cool treat on a sunny day. I got the pop of the month, which was salted caramel cheesecake. It was tasty!"
1471,7/9/2017,David L.,fort-worth,3,"I came here because of the popularity, but the ice creams are not as unique as expected. I got the strawberry popsicle which is $3, and I thought it was going to be extraordinary... but it tasted like the ones that you can buy at Target... The ice creams melt pretty fast and pretty busy in there. The place is pretty small, and there are not many seats in there. The table is made of concrete which I found it interesting... This place is good if you're just looking for an ice cream place to eat but as good as the hype of the popularity."
1472,7/5/2017,Drew C.,fort-worth,3,Good but not great. Poor seating options. Only popsicles not real ice cream. Parking is nonexistent. I had the jalapeño pineapple pop which was a brave pairing and enjoyable. They should not over charge people who want water as well.
1473,7/6/2016,Marcia G.,fort-worth,5,"Different flavor Popsicles: fruity, creamy and cookie. I tried the strawberry shortcake which was a strawberry cream ice cream with cookie in the middle. It was so yummy. The cookie wasn't overpowering and the strawberry cream was tasty and not too sweet. It melted a little faster than normal due to the heat though. Hubby had the pineapple and that was really good and I could taste the real pineapple inside. Cute place, fast friendly service with corn hole outside if you feel like hangin out in the heat."
1474,8/23/2017,Mindi M.,fort-worth,5,"Best place in Fort Worth and Southlake for real, amazing, Popsicles year around! No really! Their flavors are unique and also seasonal and customizable (if you want it dipped and drizzled). It is one of our favorite spots to go for a treat. You can even get pops to go, and they will add a cool pack to ensure they don't melt before you get them home or to your designated location. They use real ingredients for real flavor. I would more than highly recommend this spot!"
1475,5/27/2017,Jennifer P.,fort-worth,5,"Whether the season is Texas Heat or Slightly Chilly outside, stopping by here for a Pop is SO worth it. The staff is awesome, so, unless you're dead set on a flavor you see on the menu wall, I highly recommend asking what are the best sellers then. My favs are horchata, coffee or strawberry. These are gourmet and high quality, so the price isn't cheap. Parking can be nutty during peak hours of the shops, but, again, totally worth it!"
1476,8/26/2017,Hayden Y.,fort-worth,4,"This was a cool little interesting place.  They have lots of popsicles to choose from fruit to cream flavors.  I got the cookies and cream and it was delish.  I prefer ice cream, but this was a good alternative on a hot evening."
1477,7/2/2017,Selene S.,fort-worth,4,"Awesome flavors, great place for a cool treat. Only complaint is lack of parking, but other than that fast friendly service!"
1478,1/8/2017,Scott B.,fort-worth,4,"What a cool little spot. These aren't your standard Popsicles, they're super Popsicles. They're dense and just wonderfully flavorful. There are so many varieties that will keep you coming back.Not only do they offer the sweet treats, they also make one of the best cups of coffee I've had. The place is holds an industrial decor and has a covered outside porch where you can play a solid game of cornhole. Keep an eye out for it when around W. 7th. You'll have to reward yourself with a wonderful treat."
1479,5/14/2017,Linda N.,fort-worth,5,Very fun and delightful treats that they change out. My personal favorite was the champagne tea or something like that but no longer available. It's nice that you can pack them to go in their freezer bag with ice out foam cooler box.
1480,7/17/2017,JT N.,fort-worth,4,"Good popsicles. Stopped in to see what the hype is all about. Yummy flavors, good quality, still hard for me to pay the $$ for the popsicle. Will definitely come back, but prob won't visit too often."
1481,6/24/2016,Andrew W.,fort-worth,5,"Yum & Fun!Easily a 5 star dessert joint! Pops are out of the world good! I had a Brownie Coffee Cookie pop and it was awesome! Pops are priced less than a fancy cup of coffee or ice cream, but taste much better (they do serve coffee as well.)The courtyard area is lots of fun. Everyone seemed to be having a great time. Not to mention, its in a great area of Fort Worth, surrounded by lots of restaurants and shops."
1482,5/27/2017,Eric Y.,fort-worth,5,Definitely one of the best places to enjoy a popsicle. All the flavors are unique and you won't be disappointed.
1483,8/6/2017,Lauri R.,fort-worth,5,What a great location for such an amazing treat!   Seriously.  Stand in the line even if it is out the door.  Try the peanut butter pop.  O M G
1484,10/30/2016,Khammany D.,fort-worth,3,"Pops are so savory.  Lots of flavors.  They have this cool to-go package that keeps the pops cold.  Real neat.  FYI,  they do not validate for the parking structure.  They have a parking lot in front of the place.  The wrapper for the pops are difficult to unwrap."
1485,9/23/2016,Stephanie P.,fort-worth,4,"First timer here.  Heard about this place a while back and accidentally found it today. Decided to treat the kids to keep cool for a bit and did not regret it. Customer service was great. The employee was very polite & friendly. Even gave my kids some stickers. Kids love stickers! I loved how you can watch the other employees make the ice cream. Really neat. The restrooms and sitting area (inside and outside) were very clean. Another plus. My kids loved the patio area, gave them some time to burn off their sugar rush. Reason for my four star review and not five was due to the parking situation. The parking in front of it is very small and limited. If you don't pay attention you can miss the parking structure on the right side, across the street from Steel Pops. First two hours are free though. Another reason is the pricing. I personally think its a little too much for the ice cream, but its still delicious none the less and the kids seemed to enjoy it. My kids had fun and thats enough for me to comeback again.P.S. We had the Strawberry Lemonade and Horchata Pops. Very delicious, especially the horchata one!"
1486,1/23/2017,Candy R.,fort-worth,5,Never disappointed with a delicious popsicle from this quaint popsicle stand. Unique style popsicles and other sweet treats are offered here and the vibe and location of this place is great. I enjoy the strawberry popsicle the most and highly recommend hitting this place up during the spring and summer months or just on a warm evening. The popsicle are fresh and there are an abundance of flavors to choose from. Steel city pops is the place to be for all your popsicle needs!
1487,7/31/2016,Steven Y.,fort-worth,5,"This is a great location for grabbing a quick dessert after a great meal on 7th street.  We stopped by for the first time after having lunch at one of the local restaurants.  The staff were very friendly and kept the line moving.  I got the root beer popsicle and it had great flavor.  I was surprised at how solid the pops were and they held up in the hot heat of summer pretty well.Most of the seating here is outside, so be prepared to enjoy the heat while you eat our cold desert.  We will be back for more great flavors in the future."
1488,3/15/2017,Pablo N.,fort-worth,5,All we can say was like wow.The blood orange pops were rock on.The only downside was that they could not validate the parking ticket.
1489,1/25/2017,Alisa P.,fort-worth,5,"How can you go wrong at this place ?!?!? I mean if I wanted something fruity; they got it. If I wanted something savory; they got it. They got my back with all them pops ANDDDDDDD to make that stuff even better; they then decided to dip it in chocolate and cover it in toppings too? Dude, sit down. I love this place! My favorite fruity pop is the cantaloupe! And I love butter pecan!! If you don't like one, there's bond to be something else that you're going to like."
1490,6/30/2017,Indira P.,fort-worth,4,"Great location. Love the fruit and cream varieties. I had the coconut and it was DELISH!!! The peach was okay, felt it lacked flavor. On a hot summer day, it is hard to find a place in the limited space inside. So, be prepared. But, Totally worth the trip!"
1491,1/29/2017,Whitney D.,fort-worth,5,"How can you not love Steel City Pops?!?!  With their newest addition of dipping, dredging and sprinkling you can't go wrong!"
1492,6/2/2017,Turah S.,fort-worth,5,This place is like no other. Every time we come we fall in love with another flavor. I can't even go in without getting a box!!!
1493,6/5/2017,Pao M.,fort-worth,5,I love this place!!!!! Live 40 minutes from downtown and don't mind driving for a 5 dollars popsicle!!! They recently changed the menu and the cucumber lime popsicle is just amazing! We also tried the strawberry cream covered in chocolate and it tasted like heaven!!!!!
1494,11/5/2015,Marjo M.,fort-worth,5,"It is my mission to try every single popsicle made by Steel City Pops. First, I will check off the creamy popsicle side. I have tried the Buttermilk and the Vanilla Chocolate Chip Cookie pops! I even got the extra chocolate dip which tasted amazing. It was a little hard to eat the chocolate dip because it would break off in such large sections, and I was dropping chocolate chunks everywhere! :( The cream popsicles we very flavorful, not too sweet, which I really appreciate. There is indoor and outdoor seating! And a very good photo opportunity with the ginormous sign they have outside.They are next to a free 2-hour garage parking building!Hey Steel City Pops employees, it wouldn't hurt to smile, would it? :)I'll keep coming back until I've tried them all!"
1495,6/24/2016,Nicole W.,fort-worth,5,"Omg this place is freakin awesome! There are creamy options and fruity options available. I got peach and my husband got coffee brownie! Oh man, it was the best Popsicle I've ever had in my life! They tasted so fresh, I could tell the ingredients were high quality and it's not sticky like those high fructose corn syrup Popsicles you find in the grocery store. You can also buy 4 for $11 or a dozen for $33 and they pack it in dry ice so it doesn't melt on your drive home. Everyone was super friendly and greeted us with warm happy smiles! You can also watch their whole operation through the window as they make their pops and there is plenty of seating outside. If you wanted to walk around there are plenty of shops in the area to see and there are multiple parking garages that charge nothing for 0-2 hour parking."
1496,9/17/2015,Steve H.,fort-worth,3,"So the idea of gourmet popsicles does appeal to me! Especially on a hot summer day! My wife had been wanting to go here for a while so we decided to hit em up. The building they are in has a nice modern design and all of their signage has a really cool metal aesthetic. I was impressed by their store front for sure. There was a line but we are sort of used to lines for food, when I see a line I usually assume I'm in for a treat. They have a bourbon popsicle sometimes which sounds amazing but they didn't have it the day I was there. I got my favorite a watermelon pop and it was great! The thing is I get watermelon popsicles from the Carnicería down the street from my house all the time, they cost 99 cents and are every bit as good as the popsicle I had here.Its hard for me to justify the cost here when I've had just as good for cheaper, I will say the quality of the popsicles is amazing they seem to be very fresh much fresher than what I get at the Carnicería and if I would give them props for anything its that extreme freshness. I will definitely go back and try more flavors!"
1497,11/17/2016,Hanisha P.,fort-worth,5,First time coming here tonight and tried the Oreo popsicle. It was great! Will definitely be visiting next time I'm in Fort Worth
1498,8/28/2015,Amanda S.,fort-worth,4,"Fresh made popsicles is definitely something I say yes to!  This was a place I was looking forward to checking out on a hot summer day and I am absolutely a fan.  The shop is small, but everything is open space. If you are lucky you might catch them making a batch of delicious pops while you wait in line.  There are quite of few options on the menu.  You have fruity, creamy and cookies options as well as other creative creations.  Since it was hot out I definitely wanted something refreshing and decided to go with the fruity hibiscus popsicle.  My husband loves watermelon and went with that one.  My hibiscus was delicious and exactly what I expected and wanted.  I even tasted of the watermelon and it was good too.  They sell their pops individually or in bulk.  I saw many people buying in bulk and they package them up nicely so they will stay frozen on your way home.  There were so many other flavors to try here!  I would love to stop back in and try something new!  I am curious about the pops that have a cookie in the middle and the maple bacon with bourbon ... hello!  This place is definitely cool."
1499,1/7/2017,Brittney D.,fort-worth,5,"This place will never disappoint! You can just taste all the fresh ingredients they use in their pops. So worth it! Despite it being 30ish degrees, this place was poppin' on a Saturday night! There are only a couple of seats inside so we just took ours to go and ate it in the car. It surprisingly lasted for like 15 mins without melting into a mess! It's really hard to find parking in the area. Whatever you do, DO NOT park in the garage! It's a fixed rate (I think $15?) no matter how long you're in there. Luckily I was warned ahead of time :)"
1500,5/21/2017,John A.,fort-worth,4,"I've always enjoyed going to this location. You can never go wrong with ice cream popsicles!! Only downfall is that they don't validate parking if you park in the garage next to their store. Other than that, I will Definently go here again."
1501,6/8/2017,Whitney L.,fort-worth,4,"Cute place and fun menu. It was busy on a Thursday night- the line was out the door! I ordered the cantaloupe popsicle and loved it.  I want to go back and try some of the other flavors like lime or watermelon. My friend ordered the peaches and cream one and loved it, too. You probably can't go wrong here! Definitely recommend you stopping in and trying one of the fresh flavored treats!"
1502,2/7/2017,Kristina H.,fort-worth,5,"Went here for the first time a few days ago with some friends, and you know what, I just can NOT get this place off of my mind. I'm sitting here at work wondering if I have time to drive by and pick one up on my lunch break, unfortunately the answer is no. No I do not have time to drive 30 minutes one way!!!BUT that is how good this place is, I got the Strawberry Lemonade, I was afraid it was going to be too bitter due to the lemonade but it was PERFECT, it was the perfect blend of sweet and sour, it wasn't too much of either, and it was seriously the best popsicle I have ever had in my entire LIFE! Nothing compares. I can't wait to take my fiance there and have him try one, and next time I am def going to try a creamy one, although I might have to take a fruity one to go too. If you run across this place, do NOT pass it, it will change your life how you see popsicles! Beware of parking ,very limited parking. Also very limited seating inside, I think there was 4 stools and that's it.  Also, very friendly staff, I didn't feel rushed at all and they took the time to explain what fruity/creamy meant. LOVED IT!"
1503,7/8/2015,Eric T.,fort-worth,4,"I came here at the invitation of some Yelp friends, not knowing what to expect. Upon reaching the door, I noticed that Steel City Pops was a creamery, not a 7th street bar or music venue. Noting that the line went out of the door (on a Tuesday night, no less), my interest grew even more. What the heck was so good about a creamery that the line would be out of the door on a Tuesday night? After waiting for 10 minutes, I understood why. For a thick, creamy popsicle of various flavors for $3-4, Steel City's frozen deliciousness was well worth the wait. I had a strawberry shortcake, of which I savored every lick & bite while discussing what was on my mind with the other three Yelpers. Although the seating area on the inside of the creamery was limited, I noted that there was much more outdoor seating. It was also a good thing to see children & adults of all ages enjoying so many different flavors of popsicles. Can't wait to see this creamery on the weekend!"
1504,11/6/2016,Nini N.,fort-worth,4,took my mom on a stroll of the 7th St play area.... i told her about these grate pop ice place and she was stocked to go. she got the Vanilla Bean and Strawberry  she was sooooooooo happy when she took a bite of the Strawberry she couldn't wait to come back so this will be our girls day out on weekends. so many types to choose from fruit to creamy. have at it my POP LOVES
1505,9/21/2015,Karissa S.,fort-worth,5,"This was my first time coming to this place, and I absolutely loved it!The line was all the way out of the door, and it was definitely worth the wait. I ate the coconut one and I am looking forward to returning and trying one of the many other flavors.However, I will have to stay away from the cream ones as I am a little lactose and tolerant.  As good as the coconut was, the cream did not bode well with my stomach :(IT WAS STILL TOTALLY WORTH IT!I might check and see if they have any soy options, if they did.... that would be even better!I will definitely be returning here again!"
1506,5/26/2017,Shannon G.,fort-worth,5,"I absolutely love this place. The flavors that they come up with are fresh, seasonal, and I crave their Popsicles quite often. I go more for the fruity ones although I tried my a chocolate one dipped in chocolate and almost died it was so good. I also love the fact that if you are shopping or doing something in the area you can order them and then they will place them on hold for you in their freezer and you can scoop them up later quickly and leave. They also give you a cool pack so that you can transport them home (and let's get real, I order several for the week). For cripes sake, my profile picture is of me eating their Popsicles. Treat yo self today!"
1507,6/11/2015,Katherine W.,fort-worth,5,"If eating a Popsicle with a frozen brownie inside is wrong, I don't wanna be right.I walked in not expecting much out of a Popsicle place. I walked out ready to come back the next day. Steel city pops is one of the best dessert/snack, heck I would even come here for lunch, breakfast, and dinner if I could. They have a wide range of flavors but I recommend the brownie pops, preferably the coffee one though they tend to run out. If you see a long line, don't be discouraged because it usually moves very fast and is worth the wait. To sum it up in one senence, the hype is REAL."
1508,7/16/2015,Eric W.,fort-worth,4,"All right. I like it. I'm a fan. I was down this way and wanting something cool, sweet, and hopefully low calorie. SCP came to mind. I've heard of them, but never tried them. I was hoping to try try some really crazy flavor, perhaps something with chile, but that did not seem to be an option today. Of the choices on offer, cantaloupe caught my eye (see photo). I liked it, I would have it again. Hopefully I'll have a friend, a good friend, with me next time so we can ""trade licks"" and I can try more flavors. Or, I wish they had mini-pops, so I could have tried more flavors, and maybe bring some home. Bottom line: I liked it. $3 struck me as a bit expensive, but it was worth it. Also fun to watch the pop making process from the seats inside (which there are not many, but there is seating outside too) .PS. Wish all pictures of pops (here)  also had the flavor listed. Hint hint people. I'm marking all un-flavored pop pictures ""Not Helpful""."
1509,8/15/2016,Sabine F.,fort-worth,5,"Omg, delicious healthy ice Creme in all kinds of flavored. Definitely some thing different from the norm. Bought 5 ice creamed in Fort Worth and took it with us to San Antonio. Most of the ice Creme made it back and it tasted phenomenal. We had strawberry Creme, peanut butter and other flavored."
1510,9/9/2016,Annette N.,fort-worth,5,"The parking is awful...but a good walk and we all need Thant anyway, right? It's so worth it for the Popsicles. We got several different flavors but watermelon was my favorite"
1511,2/15/2017,Elaine V.,fort-worth,4,This place is adorable. We heard about it and just had to stop over. I am not giving this a 5 star because they didn't have anything sugar free. Otherwise the staff was friendly and answered all my questions about the products and my daughter/husband loved their pops!
1512,2/28/2016,Tony S.,fort-worth,4,"Full discloser, I have only had one of their popsicles.  But our daughter absolutely LOVES this place.  So my 4 stars is based on her review and the long lines of people who seem to always be waiting in line no matter what the weather is.  Besides having really tasty popsicles, I think their claim to fame is being able to put your popsicle in some sort of bag that keeps the popsicle from melting."
1513,6/18/2016,Catherine P.,fort-worth,5,"After a long, hot, Texas summer day, a cool popsicle was all I wanted! With so many flavors to choose from, it was tough to pick just one. That's why I got some to-go! My favorites were piña colada and creamy peach, but I also tried strawberry basil, passionfruit, chai latte, cantaloupe, and champagne white tea."
1514,4/24/2017,Cheryl T.,fort-worth,4,"The Popsicles are incredible. I've had numerous flavors and I have always been completely satisfied. I'm giving it four stars because the location sucks. Parking is inconvenient even though there's a garage next-door, it's not convenient when you have a feisty toddler. Also, eating outdoors is gross because of the huge restaurant trash container next to the seating area. Other than that, the Popsicles are superb. I am more than an ecstatic that there's a more convenient location at Waterside near Bryant Irvin... excellent parking, great location and pleasant outdoor seating."
1515,4/6/2015,Gricelda P.,fort-worth,4,"Delicious pops made with fresh ingredients. You can taste the freshness when you bite into it.The texture of the pops is nice and smooth, not just a block of ice like other ice pops.They always have a huge variety of creamy and fruity. I personally love the mango and the blood orange pops. They are located right next to the parking garage, so it's pretty convenient. The employee was not super friendly, but I still would recommend this place."
1516,10/5/2016,Mary Y.,fort-worth,5,"Oh. My. Heaven. If you're an ice cream lover, this is a must try. I tried the Carrot Cake Popsicle and it was phenomenal. Truly tasted like creamy carrot cake with a crunchy layer of toasted pecans to finish it off. There's a reason why the line is out the door on a warm night. However, service was super fast and very friendly. The praise for this place is highly deserved."

Updated review",Cecilia P.,fort-worth,5,"Was hoping they had mango today on the list but they didn't. My sister is a fan of the blood orange. Coconut is great, can't go wrong with that. Cantaloupe, what I love about the fruit is that it's not too sweet, and this Popsicle taste like like the fruit. Passion fruit smells and taste like the fruit as well! The orange mint green tea tasted like herbs, very healthy. Summer is coming and can't wait to try more! $3 a Popsicle, if you want to take it to go... They'll put in a little brown bag ziplock w/ an ice pack inside for you to take home.EDIT: March 27I'm unsure what they're doing to their parking but it's currently under construction! Finally got the try the mango and I am in love with it! It literally taste just like the mango fruit. They should make a mangonada Popsicle next! I also love the banana one."
1518,6/23/2017,Bailey G.,fort-worth,5,"Neat atmosphere and the pops are homemade! Definitely refreshing, especially on a hot day!"
1519,7/10/2016,Nikki A. J.,fort-worth,5,Once again a great place to grab a cool treat on a hot steamy night. I ventured in for a Pineapple Pop and it was delicious. The bites of actual pineapple let me know that I wasn't dealing with any ole store bought popsicle but an actual crafted piece of goodness that strives to give us fresh ingredients that makes them stand out from the rest!
1520,10/16/2015,Shane F.,fort-worth,4,"A simple concept, and a popular one in the summer months of Texas. A dedicated popsicle store, Steel City has numerous options for pops. The prices are decent enough for a boutique store, but don't expect $1 pops here. Their cookie pops are good, but I usually go for the fruit options. Clean-tasting, fresh and flavorful (and crammed to the gills with pulp), the fruit options are easily the best choice at SCP. The area inside is super crammed, so be aware that you will be up in someone's grill while you're waiting to order. Still, there are a few tables where you can sit down and enjoy your pop. I believe they do have freeze pouches for take-out, but they can only prevent melting for a predetermined amount of time (I think 30 min). A solid choice for dessert after eating in the West 7th street area."
1521,10/21/2015,Ashley T.,fort-worth,4,"My sister heard about this place and we decided to go after we ate lunch on a weekend. It's located near a really nice shopping center that has several retail stores and restaurants. We parked in a garage and when we found the store, we didn't have to wait very long to get our popsicles. My sister chose the Vanilla Chocolate Chip and I got the Blueberry Basil, which was really fresh and refreshing. I wasn't sure what to expect when I bit into my popsicle, but the fragrance from the basil combined with blueberries made it interesting and tasty on a hot summer day. I could tell it was made with fresh ingredients because I could see and taste bits of blueberry and basil. I took a bite of my sister's popsicle, and it was delicious. Out of the two, I would recommend the Vanilla Chocolate Chip, especially if you like rich and creamy desserts.Another thing to note is that the menu lists the flavors as well as the calories for each popsicle, which I really appreciate."
1522,4/9/2016,Brian J.,fort-worth,4,"You may be asking ""It's frozen flavored water, so what's the big deal?""  Well you would be partially right, but you're missing that they do this extremely well, and besides basic flavors they also have creme-sidles and some pretty exotic varieties.  It is not a place that I crave to get a treat from, but since my wife and son love it, I'm happy to take them.  His favorite current flavor is lemon icebox pie.  It does have some pie crust in it, and it is pretty amazing."
1523,9/29/2015,Terry G.,fort-worth,5,"Ok, you've read all the reviews either before or after mine. This place is WONDERFUL.Quit wasting time and go get a pop. How can you go wrong?"
1524,5/10/2016,Stacy Y.,fort-worth,5,"It was my first time in Fort Worth in a loooong time, and it was such a beautiful day outside--how could we resist dropping by Steel City Pops?! This location has a significantly larger patio than the one in Dallas, but it was still plenty crowded inside. There were a lot of new flavors I hadn't seen before, including passion fruit and creamy jasmine green tea, which I was really tempted to try. However, I'm still the ultimate sucker for the classic chocolate popsicle, so that's what I went with, haha. Delish as always!"
1525,10/18/2015,Patricia E.,fort-worth,5,"I was ""kidnapped"" and taken here by some hardcore fans, and now I get it. Not the easiest place to find, but very quaint. I'd nickname it an adult's ice cream shop but that's probably trivializing it.Love that the calories are listed. Had the pineapple jalapeno, which I think had more red pepper in it than jalapeno, but whatever. Took me quite a while to finish it because it was made with actual pineapple and not watered down Kool Aid.There were other interesting combinations I'd like to try; I anticipate ""kidnapping"" myself for a second visit."
1526,11/5/2014,Amy T.,fort-worth,5,I never thought something as simple as a popsicle could be done so well.  Steel City Pops has definitely mastered the art of popsicles.  I have literally craved this place every day since my initial visit.We came here about an hour before closing on a random weekday and became a bit bummed that a lot of the flavors were sold out.  I ended up trying a creamy pumpkin popsicle and it was the kind of delicious I get all bug eyed over.  The service was ok.  Obviously I had a lot of questions..their flavors are so different and I wanted to make sure I got the perfect popsicle so I could love the place.  Obviously!I can't wait to slowly check off each flavor!
1527,2/7/2017,Tracey J.,fort-worth,5,I have not actually been to a steel city pops location but I have had their popsicles.  They have had a cart at our church on many occasions when we have food trucks or big outdoor activities.  I always get excited when they are there or I know they are coming.  Such a refreshing and healthy treat.  I absolutely love the BLOOD ORANGE popsicle.  It's my favorite! Wish I could eat one everyday!!
1528,9/1/2015,Jay S.,fort-worth,5,"POPsitively SUCKulent! I love the concept of fresh-made, couture popsicle flavors and this place gets it right. Hopefully, they offer free replacements for kids who drop them on the floor. At about $3 a pop, it's a nice alternative to an ice cream shop. Hopefully, they'll keep opening new stores.And great signage!"
1529,5/8/2016,Jennifer M.,fort-worth,5,"Fun little place across from Fred's. Got the Coconut, Pina Colada, Vanilla Chocolate chip, and the Caramel. Fast, friendly service. They have a small patio to enjoy your sweet treats on and bonus- you can listen to the music from Fred's! Will definitely be back."
1530,5/21/2016,Melissa Y.,fort-worth,4,"My kid loves this place! She is a huge fan of the strawberry lemonade and lime popsicles. A little on the pricy side for a popsicle, but nothing beats strolling down Foch and Crockett with a little treat every now and then :). Wish they had a lower sugar/no sugar/no artificial sweetener option (too much to ask for maybe??) popsicle, then I will gladly partake."
1531,7/17/2014,Heather S.,fort-worth,5,"I don't have to drive to Dallas for these scrumptious frozen bits of heaven!I love how they utilized the space- it is located directly across from Fred's- I don't, however, like that you are not allowed to use the parking garages or if its a Friday night- cant find street parking anywhere! (Minus one star) I drove around in my car drooling for thirty minutes the night they opened and finally just gave up.I made it back yesterday with my sister and her two kids in tow and it was a Wednesday afternoon so- no problems parking. I was disappointed that they were out of a lot of flavors- I didn't get my Cherry Sour Cream but settled for a Blood Orange instead. My sister got the Hibiscus- if any of you like Aguas Frescas its basically frozen Jamaica- and a Pineapple Jalapeno to go for her hubs. The babies got banana and a chocolate. My sister tasted the banana and couldn't get over how it tasted like a real banana and not ""banana flavoring"".We sat and watched the workers through the large glass partition (its totally open so you can watch them juicing cucumbers and mashing strawberries) in the kitchen as they scrambled to make more pops. I told my sister the reason the pops actually taste like the real thing is because that is what is in them- she turns to see a chick mashing up fresh blueberries and dumping it into the pop molds. You totally don't have to feel bad about eating these bad boys- its not a whole bunch of corn syrup and artificial flavors. The pops are about $3 bucks each- and you can buy ""packs"" of them that come with a little brown insulated bag and ice pack that will get you 30 minutes to shove them in your mouth or freezer. I recommend your mouth..I really hope they get the parking under control- the manager said they had a meeting with the ""powers that be"" regarding letting them use the garages, but he also said that a lot of the small shops on 7th told them that they would validate SCP's customers for them so we didn't have to fight anyone for spots.So go put some of these in yo mouth! Right meow!"
1532,8/19/2015,Sarah S.,fort-worth,5,Who doesn't love a popsicle on a hot summer day?!?!?Yes they are on the pricier side... But they are fresh and delish!! I got the blueberry basil! It was phenomenal!! I was surprise it had whole blueberries! I can't wait to come back and try a creamy one!
1533,7/14/2015,Reena D.,fort-worth,5,Finally came hereeee and been here a few times since then.  I was able to try two flavors.  My favorite was the Carmel one.  It was so creamy and refreshing on a hot summer night.  I also tried the Banana flavor which had cinnamon.  It was light and really good  but my favorite so far has been the Caramel!  Can't wait to try other flavors!
1534,11/16/2015,Jennifer N.,fort-worth,5,"Came here on a week night and there was a line out the door. We had nothing better to do so we stood in line anyways. The line moved fast though to my surprise. There are a good amount of options. I got the Strawberry Shortcake and the Strawberry Lemonade, both were really good. They give you a little freezer bag if you take some to go. I would definitely come back and recommend it."
1535,6/3/2017,C S.,fort-worth,4,"The line was long, but the popsicles were a lovely way to cool down on a hot day. As someone who is lactose intolerant, I appreciated that the flavors are broken up in to creamy (with dairy) and fruity (without). The popsicles were delicious and my husband loved that they could be dipped in chocolate. There was limited seating inside and a few tables outside with corn hole. We were very disappointed that they do not validate parking, especially given the fact that their parking lot is minuscule and they are located across the street from the parking garage."
1536,7/17/2014,Kerissa B.,fort-worth,5,"I went to Steel City Pops in Dallas just a few weeks ago and had no idea one was opening here! In the week since it's been open, I've been three times already! I've had blueberry basil, blood orange and lemonade flavors. While trying a bit (of my niece's) avocado and cantaloupe! I love this place. Fresh ingredients and you can watch them making the popsicles from the seats inside.I've only been in the day, so it's easy street parking. They don't validate (they asked to be a part of the W 7th parking garages and got turned down!) but you can always pop into another shop and get validated if there's no street parking. Lovely patio area, where I was able to sit with my puppy in the shade."
1537,5/13/2016,Tim W.,fort-worth,5,"The most awesome shop with out of this world popsicles.  The blackberry, mango and coconut flavors are some of our favs.  They have some seating outside, and its pup friendly.  DOn't be a jerk get your good puppy dog a popsicle too."
1538,8/4/2015,Geoffrey T.,fort-worth,5,"Avocado pop yeah!Then I can back in a week with my lady. You really can't go wrong with this place. All the pops are delicious. I'm a fan of the funky, so avocado or buttermilk pops are my favorite - all the way."
1539,7/30/2016,Jessica M.,fort-worth,5,"Wow!!! Amazimg!! Each pop is $3, and they have a ton of selections.  In my group we tried peaches &cream, watermelon,caramel, and blood orange.  All of them were super delicious, the cream was amazing with the fruit ones were super juicy.  They do have the calories for 3ach pop posted, but I'm sure they all include tons of sugar.  This is a great treat on those hot Texas summer days!"
1540,9/6/2014,Grace D.,fort-worth,4,"This place is cute - a great spot to come for an afternoon treat and cool down. Seating is offered inside and out, and the outside seats are shaded by big umbrellas, so not so bad even during the day. There's two menus, fruity and creamy. The fruity menu is more ice-y, a true fruit Popsicle. The creamy is what you would expect, more like ice cream on a stick. The staff was super friendly and helpful explaining the flavors (and helping me with my decision crisis). I had the blueberry basil, and it tasted exactly like how it sounded - AMAZING. I think it came out to be about ~$4 for one pop, so a fair price for a good dessert out. I'll definitely be coming back soon!"
1541,10/22/2015,Will W.,fort-worth,5,"Great post dinner hang.Peanut butter, yes. Brownie in a popsicle, heck yes. Banana pudding popsicle, Oh LAWWD YASS. Parking is a beating but it's worth it. Great group hang."
1542,6/3/2015,Krista R.,fort-worth,4,"I haven't quite decided if I like Steel City Pops or not. I'm nice and rounded up to 4 stars. I mean it's a good concept. The flavor of the pops are good. We had strawberry and strawberry lemonade.I have never been a big Popsicle eater. Mostly due to fact that you got to sink your teeth into something cold as hell and you get the god awful brain freeze and makes your teeth hurt. They melt fast and they are messy. So while you don't have to bite into them, you can wait until they melt a little and suck on it. Then it's just a sticky mess from there on. Yeah...."
1543,5/20/2015,Kelicia C.,fort-worth,5,I can't even right now. I think I may be back a million times this summer. I mean what do you say to a place that offers your life dreams on a stick? And then you can watch them make that dream wether it be creamy or fruity! Man please. This may be heaven....it really may be. Shout out to Heather for the introduction bc I have a new addiction now.
1544,10/24/2014,Gregory B.,fort-worth,5,Very unique concept out of the usual ice cream in a cone or cup thingy. These are flavored Popsicles made against a constantly changing pallet of flavors.  There are fruity and creamy selections (about 10 on each side) such as pink grapefruit with pink peppercorns and maple bacon with bourbon.  Pops are $2.77 each so that with tax it's an even $3. Or buy 4 for $10.  Most of the seating is outdoors and you dog is welcome on the patio!!!This is NOT YO MOMMY'S Popsicle
1545,4/26/2016,Emily M.,fort-worth,4,I like how there's different variety of flavors that they make. The line here and get pretty long and the outside seating can fill up pretty quickly. The Parking lot area is getting under construction so you might have to parking the garage.
1546,7/1/2016,Jay B.,fort-worth,2,"Am I the only one that compares these with sucking on a frozen chunk of flavored plastic? I've been here 6 times and each time I'm more disappointed. Here's what I've tried. -jalepeno pineapple. ( gross)-strawberry (boring)- buttermilk. ( gross then once it melts, decent)-chocolate ( blah)-blueberry ( wax)- ice t ( returned it )- coffee (right into the garbage) I dunno I'm just not a fan I guess. I'll take froyo over this miss."
1547,1/15/2016,Hailey G.,fort-worth,4,"Yummm these popsicles are so good. I've only tried the cucumber lime and it was great. I couldn't finish it, the taste gets a little strong after awhile. It's really refreshing on a super hot day though. We don't find ourselves here too often simply because of parking, seating, etc. but it's well worth the hassle:)"
1548,5/15/2015,Corina T.,fort-worth,5,"Great place for a cool treat or an after meal dessert.Headed in here after a stroll around west 7th. I picked out a coffee Popsicle with brownie, hubs for a buttermilk one and my little guy got a strawberry lemonade one.They were all very tasty. The addition of my brownie was so satisfying! My husband's buttermilk pop was creamy with a nice tang.I liked how they had quick 20 minute parking available in an area where parking is at a premium. They're not what I'd consider cheap but as a quick treat they're great. Don't forget to pick up your punch card cause it works at their vendor carts as well!"
1549,4/23/2016,Amy A.,fort-worth,5,"I used to think ""what's the deal it's just popsicles"" I was wrong! All natural no added sugars so it's a win from that alone. The mango pop literally tasty like frozen mango lol. The have fruity and creamy options to choose flavors from. It's tucked across from Fred's so look for the steel city pops sign, can't miss it. And don't let the long line deter you, they move quick!"
1550,9/8/2015,Edmund F.,fort-worth,5,"So what's not to like about this place?  The lines may be long, but they turn around time is blazingly fast, and the popsicles have original flavor combinations which are quite refereshingService: 5 starsStaff is incredibly well trained, I've always had to start lining up well outside the front door, I'm typically enjoying my popsicle within a few minutes.Food: 4.5 starsI haven't had a popsicle here I didn't like.  Great treat to cool off during the summer heat.Coffee 5: This one is dipped in some sort of expresso coating.  The popsicle is has a very creamy texture with a very pronounced coffee flavor.  Blueberry basil: 4The blueberry flavor is very prominent but the basil was a bit lacking.  There are also pieces of real bluberry within the pop.  Personally I really liked the texture contrast, but it may not be for everyone.Strawberry: 4Their take on the classic is very well done.  Blood orange: 5This one might be my personal favorite.  Great combination of acidity and sweetness, very refreshing."
1551,9/6/2015,Manali M.,fort-worth,4,"Excellent pops- lives up to its name. We had the creamy pops- chocolate, chocolate brownie & banana- all yummy! Definitely worth a stop after the stockyards or museum on a hot summer day."
1552,6/20/2015,Viralyn K.,fort-worth,4,"I'm a bit obsessed. Yeah, it is just your average popsicle, but who really wants to put in the time to make it yourself? Passion fruit, blood orange, cucumber lime, perfect and convenient to cool off during high temperatures. If I want to be real fancy, the brownie pops are amazing. Coffee brownie..... Yummmm. There's a wee lot up front which makes it easy to go in and out and a ticketed parking garage is right next door."
1553,5/12/2015,Bethany W.,fort-worth,3,Darn it....when I came they didn't have the flavors that I was looking forward to.  The blood orange flavor was good but they are kept at such a cold temp that they are really frozen solid so I pretty much had to bit my way through it.  I really wasn't able to suck on it and get any juice from it.  Might try them again next time I'm in town when it's warmer.
1554,8/9/2016,Alice D.,fort-worth,5,Perfect treat to beat the heat on any HOT Texas summer day. The Popsicles may seem steep at $3 a pop but trust me it's worth it. The sweet tea one was just delicious! The taste of tea comes through perfectly and isn't overly sweet. They even have umbrellaed seating outside for you to enjoy your treat in the shade. They offer so many different flavors that it was hard to choose just one but I'll be back to try the others for sure.
1555,3/30/2016,Wilhelmina M.,fort-worth,5,"I love this place! Cute place for a quick date. Their popsicles are awesome! I've tried the coconut and the strawberry one so far and they were both great!Tried some champagne tea pop or something like that, I dont recommend trying it. It tastes like pure sugar. Chai latte is a great flavor though!"
1556,12/24/2015,Mary L.,fort-worth,4,"My friend and I were craving the coconut flavored pops but when we arrived, the menu had changed and we didn't know it changed seasonally! I ended up getting the coffee. I've already tried that one but honestly, it's the next best thing or maybe I'm too scared to go out of my comfort zone, haha. My friend got the cranberry orange one and he said he liked it! Got a bit bitter near the end with the orange peels, but he didn't mind! I bought a 4 pack home as well, we always do when we go here. Parents loved the coffee and cranberry orange. I tried the Clementine. Not bad! I liked it!"
1557,8/9/2014,Lindy C.,fort-worth,2,They have both creamy and fruity Popsicles that are about $3 each. They're constantly making pops so you can usually watch them making Popsicles which is pretty cool to watch. I had the blood orange and the blueberry basil. Blood orange was okay but I should've tried one of their creamy pops. The blueberry basil was unique but I was not a fan because the basil was so overpowering I could barely taste any blueberry at all. I feel like your money would be better spent going to trader joes or central market and buying a pack of popsicles.
1558,7/26/2015,Kerry N.,fort-worth,4,"Just what you need on a hot day in Texas: a stellar popsicle. My favorite is the caramel; it's like a.... well, a caramel popsicle. Get one! Recently, I tried the piña colada. Not exciting. The ""restaurant"" itself is fun and trendy. However, it is small and slammed. The outdoor tables are filthy with melted popsicle remnants and dirty napkins everywhere. More staff is needed."
1559,5/9/2016,Katie A.,fort-worth,5,"My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try this place for a while, and finally went with my mother and younger sister the day after Mother's Day. We are definitely impressed and more than satisfied. I got the champagne white tea, and it tastes heavenly. My mother got a caramel creamy pop, which I tried. It was absolutely perfect, not overwhelmingly sweet like caramel can be. She also got a strawberry lemonade pop. My boyfriend got lavender lemonade, and enjoyed it immensely. My sister got honeydew, and didn't care for it (I tried it and liked it, but she's 8 and picky). They allowed her to trade her popsicle in for a new one, since she didn't like it. The decor is cool, the location is great, and the pops were delicious. The girl working there was super friendly :) We will definitely be coming back!!"
1560,5/2/2015,Lena D.,fort-worth,5,"EVERYONE!! The Steel City Pops hype is real! I tried avoiding this place at first because a lot of people had mixed feelings about the place but now I know I should stop listening to other people and experience it for myself. The ice cream may be more on the pricier side but I don't mind. I believe it's worth what you pay for and it's a great, refreshing experience as well.My friend and I got the Orange Mint Green Tea, Vanilla w/ Cookie, and Strawberry Cream. They were all SOOO good. I definitely recommend those flavors if you don't know what to choose! I'm not sure if I'm being exaggerated but I loved all the flavors we bought. I'm excited to come back and try out more on the menu!If you need advice on where to park, there is a small parking lot in front of the location on Currie St. and there is a parking garage conveniently located behind the location. The parking garage is free for your first 2 hours so if you can't get parking in the front, just park in the garage! No need for ticket parking validation from Steel City Pops either."
1561,4/12/2015,Mimi H.,fort-worth,5,"A bit expensive for a popsicle, but I think its good as a once in a while treat. Great, wholesome ingredients! I highly recommend the vanilla and brownie. Its so delicious!"
1562,4/7/2017,Amanda J.,fort-worth,3,"Worth visiting if you happen to be walking by.  The pops were just ok, not as good as the hype had led me to believe they were.  My pop was gritty.  Terrible parking situation - do not drive here."
1563,2/1/2015,Ashleigh D.,fort-worth,3,"I hope this trend dies with the Harlem Shake. I seriously don't get the fad of freezing basil and raspberry together and calling it a $4 investment for your mouth. The interior is cute and snug with bar seating and a chalkboard menu, and the exterior is really where all the seating is. I don't see this being a viable business plan in the winter. I think everyone fighting for a piece of the pie on West 7th will eventually push this place out. The trend will only last so long."
1564,12/21/2015,Jay K.,fort-worth,3,"This place is what you make of it. It can be pricey at $3 a pop or a fun date night where you stroll about on West 7th and make your way to the heart of it. I enjoyed my experience as I came when they first opened and revisited on two other occassions. They offer creamy and fruity flavors with fruity being my favorite - strawberry or bloodorange (when they have it).They are friendly and want to offer innovative flavors. It's cool to hang out at the store front on a hot Texan summer day and lick up a melting fruity pop. But it's true, too, that there is a Target nearby and you can get boxes of ice cream for $3. I've had my fill of it and not in a hurry to revisit, but on the other hand, wouldn't mind if a big group of us went.Again, it's what you make of it. :)"
1565,3/4/2016,Bill K.,fort-worth,4,"We had blueberry cream, strawberry lemonade and raspberry lemonade. Clean atmosphere. Rapid service. Pops were good. Recommended."
1566,4/2/2016,Horacio C.,fort-worth,5,The ice cream pops are the best...the long line to purchase should indicate the quality of this frozen treat. Check it out and enjoy the best.
1567,9/26/2016,Rita C.,fort-worth,5,Incredible and unique Popsicles! Who knew pops would be the new froyo?Almost always a line (especially in summer) but it moves quickly! Staff are super friendly and more than willing to share what their favorite are.Pops come in two versions : ice and creamy. Great for those that might be lactose intolerant or in the mood for something like ice cream.Favorite flavors include strawberry lemonade and cookies n cream!Tip: ask for napkins or even a water cup - they melt fast in the Texas heat!
1568,8/2/2016,Icha S.,fort-worth,4,"I missed steelcity pop now that I'm so far away. This was the spot no matter the weather outside. I would get few boxes twice a month of the chocolate brownie, vanilla brownie, banana, and plain chocolate. I wish you would open a branch in Seattle! The vanilla brownie is hands down my favourite. In the summer days lighter flavours is great to cool you down with the avocado or strawberry with a twist! In the colder days you can dip them in chocolate! Whenever I visit Fort Worth, steelcity would be number one on the list of must visit! You won't be disappointed. Oh! Don't forget the punchcard if they still do it now!"
1569,4/5/2015,Peter S.,fort-worth,4,"Ah spring is finally here, and what better way to enjoy the nice weather with some all natural Popsicles! I've always seen pictures of this place envious of my friends pops, so I was really stoked that I got to come try myself. The inside isn't too big, but space is plentiful for a line and they have a few tables outside. They divy up the menu from the Popsicles made from strictly fruits, or the options that would be more of a creamy texture such as peanut butter. I am a huge avocado fan so I opted for the avocado. The flavor was nice, but it wasn't much avocado flavor. It should be the lime Popsicle honestly, but it wasn't bad. I'm sure I'll be back soon when the weather permits and have a peanut butter pop. They have a punch card for those regulars, so every 10 you'll get one free!"
1570,12/19/2014,Jessica N.,fort-worth,5,"I went to Steel City Pops last night as a pre-exam pump-me-up treat and it was awesome!  Even though it was pretty cold outside, I couldn't pass up all those flavors!  They have a large variety of creamy and fruity flavors and a lot of them are seasonal (my fave).I got the maple bacon with bourbon flavor and it was awesome.  There was a ton of bacon at the beginning and end of the popsicle and a lot of creamy smooth maple-bourbon in the middle.  They did not scrimp on the bacon, let me tell you.  It was nice and crunchy and meaty. There wasn't that much bourbon flavor, but it was good nonetheless.  I would definitely recommend this flavor to those who like sweet and savory.  Definitely go out and try this place! Grab a punch card too!"
1571,11/26/2015,Tana L.,fort-worth,5,"So affordable and delicious! I love all the quirky and fun flavors they have. The best are strawberry, chocolate mint, buttermilk, and Arnold Palmer! It's hip inside and has a wonderful shopping area right outside that is in the heart of downtown Fort Worth! Love the location and the pops!"
1572,1/8/2016,Raymond O.,fort-worth,4,"Popsicles that almost popped me out of my socks. They are tasty whether you go creamy or icey. I usually stick to the fruity or tart icey popsicles, because my cavities from all the sweets over my early years... jk. Just not a big sweets fan. But these guys have interesting flavors that mom would approve of. They have a few typical flavours, but most are unique compared to freezer aisle selections. They use real fruit and ingredients too. If the pineapple and jalapeño is available, you must get it!If you're in West 7th and want to woo a pretty lady. Get with this place to start or end the night chilling by front of the store to shoot the breeeze."

Updated review",Jay A.,fort-worth,4,"Popsicles are still delicious. However, I've noticed that the employees are not friendly. Every time I've gone, I walk in and the cashier just stares at me. No greeting or anything... Then when I go up to the counter it seems like they just want me to hurry up and give them my money and leave. It's not just one specific employee, it's every STP employee I've encountered at the cash register. Chocolate-Mint is divine. Buttermilk is my new favorite. Vanilla Bean is still my husband's favorite. Plum-Rosemary is refreshingly different. Gingerbread is the only flavor I have hated here. It wasn't creamy but filmy, and the spices tasted grainy, like it hadn't melded together. Overall I will definitely keep going here but I wish they'd be more hospitable to their customers..."
1574,8/21/2016,Alesha R.,fort-worth,5,OMG!!!!!!! I am in LOVE!!! I had the cookies and cream and the chocolate!!! Can't wait to come back and try more!
1575,7/22/2016,Lauren-Ashton S.,fort-worth,3,"Delicious Popsicles but it's tablespoon of sugar with each Popsicle. While I love these Popsicles, I would love if the did a no sugar added option for a couple of the flavors!"
1576,9/5/2014,Sharde A.,fort-worth,3,"This is a better location than the Dallas one because there is more room on the inside to wait in line away from the heat.  There are more places to sit too, even tables outside shaded with a giant umbrella. The sign is also bigger and prettier here.  The area is nice and you can easily park in the garage next door.You know what though?  The popsicles are still the exact same thing.  Meh on a stick."
1577,9/8/2014,Brett I.,fort-worth,5,"steel city pops has made its way to the other side of the metroplex, say what? I have never been to their Dallas location, but the recently opened Fort Worth location hath exposed thee to the amazing-ness of popsicles; these aren't your childhood purple/red/orange-flavored popsicles from the grocery frozen section, boys and girls. These are seriously legit. Kind of like what cupcakes were around ten years ago, it's the popsicle's turn to show that it's a serious snack for even grown-ups to enjoy, i suppose.Steel City Pops is behind a parking garage near 7th street, so yes there's ample parking. And though the inside of the store is kind of small, there's more than enough seating outside to enjoy these treats.PINEAPPLE-JALAPENO. Pineapple: good. Jalapeno: also good. Pineapple-jalapeno: fantastic. Perfect amount of heat (and pieces of jalapeno inside, too!) with a full amount of juiciness from the pineapple. I was so intrigued by the flavor, mainly because I had heard of or ever before thought to eat popsicles made with pineapples and jalapenos. But it works yo, it works.STRAWBERRY-BALSAMIC. This was also an intriguing combo; normally you think of such a combination when it comes to a summer-y salad (strawberry slices drizzled with balsamic), but Steel City makes this work perfectly as it tastes exactly as you would hope.For those who like more conventional flavors, not to worry, they have those too. And I'm sure they're amazing as well. Also, it seems as though their coconut might be super delish/popular because it's been out both times I visited.This place is surely a winner, especially during hot-as-usual summers in the DFW. I just wonder how and if they'll do business when the weather gets cold. But all in all, another awesome addition to Fort Worth!"
1578,5/17/2016,Anum M.,fort-worth,2,"I don't get it. The pop were overpriced and bland. I do appreciate the pop being not saturated with sugar, but the flavor was lacking. $4.50 for a pop - no thanks. Also, the guy behind the counter was kinda grumpy. Maybe cuz I came 15 min before closing... But still you're literally handing me a pop. Tried it once but not worth it going again. The decor is pretty cool but who cares?"
1579,12/22/2015,Madalyn N.,fort-worth,3,"I've been dying to try this place and I was finally in the DFW area to try it! As recommended by the cashier, I opted for a creamy pop - egg nog flavor - as did my cousin - she got pistachio. The pistachio was great! Just a tad sweeter than pistachio ice cream. It also had a yummy crust-like lining at the bottom of the pop where you could taste little pistachio bits - delicious! The egg nog was subpar. There was a bit of a bitter lining at the top of the pop - not sure what that was. I gave this place 3 stars because the pops were a bit too creamy for my taste, and not in the good way. I love creamy ice cream! But halfway through one pop, I was left with a chalky feeling in my mouth and I realized it was caused by a dairy residue on my tongue. Not a fan. Maybe the fruit pops are better.. I'll come back next time to test it out!"
1580,9/13/2014,Linn P.,fort-worth,4,"We cannot get enough of this place.  After a test, my husband would come here and buy a 4-pack and bring it home.  If we are out with friends, this is a must stop. It is enjoyable and great to stand around talking and enjoying your pops.  The flavors they have are split into cream or fruity.  I personally love the fruity flavors, especially the lemonade. But sadly they stopped making it.  Instead they've replaced it with Hatch lemonade. I love my spicy food, but I am getting tired of all the hatch peppers added on stuff, particularly to dessert type food.  I had the banana.  It surprised me because they added some kind of spice like cinnamon? It totally threw off the banana taste and I have to say I did not enjoy it. The peanut butter, caramel, coconut, coffee, and blood orange are excellent though! Some cons.  PARKING!!! Oh my goodness.  We would circle around the place looking for a parking space.  Finally we had to just park in the garage (which does not cover Steel City Pops) and we would go to Sammy's or Paciugo and buy something small to get our parking ticket validated.  There is A LOT of melted ice cream everywhere on the ground and on the tables.  It doesn't bother me. Someone usually comes out and wipes the tables.  I do wish they had a big long washing station outside like I've seen at bbq joints.  That way there is no need to go to the restrooms just to wash your hands.  and btw. The doors to the restrooms are sticky sometimes.  We will still frequent here though.  We love it and have gotten our friends addicted to this place."
1581,8/17/2016,Stacy H.,fort-worth,5,"Great little spot for a quick treat!! The line was long m, but I was surprised how quickly it moved. We took our 5 children here one evening and they loved it. The kids tried the Watermelon flavored Popsicle,  and the Strawberry Shortcake Popsicle. I tried the Horchata Popsicle and it was very good. Perfect treat for this Texas Heat!! We will be back soon!!"
1582,7/28/2014,Kendall S.,fort-worth,5,"Oooooh la la...A sweet, trendy, and dessert-y spot where every single thing on the menu happens to be naturally gluten-free!?! I'm not even really a Popsicle person (I'm weird about cold desserts), but after seeing other people's reviews, driving by their adorable building, and battling the exhausting July heat of a Texas summer, I suddenly found myself dying to go here and give it a try. First and foremost... location, location, location. This Steel City Pops is in a great spot surrounded by a ton of new, beloved, and popular restaurants, bars, and shops, but that also means that the parking is a mess during peak times (I tried to drop in on a Friday night with zero luck). If you park in the garages, Steel City cannot validate your ticket, but any nearby business should be happy to do the favor. I decided to visit during a safe time, around 3 PM on a Monday afternoon. It was perfect because we parked across the street at Fred's and it was disgustingly hot and humid - eating a Popsicle was absolutely vital.There isn't a ton of room inside, but it's nice and shiny and modern looking and cool! They do have several little picnic tables with umbrellas outside, but I was elated to grab a seat at the bar-stool indoors since I refused to melt over the black asphalt. The menu is divided into two halves, fruity and creamy. Oh man, everything sounds so so SO good. There's a handful of pretty traditional flavors on both sides: strawberry, lemonade, chocolate, vanilla bean... but most of the flavors are a bit more interesting and exciting! For creamy you'll find avocado, buttermilk, caramel, cherry sour cream, chocolate chili, and more. On the fruity side there is blood-orange, blueberry basil, strawberry balsamic, cantaloupe, and pineapple jalapeno (and more of course). I decided to go with the cherry sour cream, which was definitely creamy and amazing with bits of real cherry all through it! Plus, this pop had the magical ability to melt slowly and I didn't have to rush to eat it with sticky-ness melting down my hands. I'm a slow eater... good thing I was inside! The  very best part of Steel City Pops is this (which is straight from their website): ""Steel City Pops are made in small batches from the freshest all-natural or certified organic ingredients, locally-harvested where possible. We only sweeten our pops with raw, organic cane sugar and never use artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives."" Hallelujah! You can actually feel pretty good about eating these amazing little sweet-treats. The only thing I wish Steel City Pops had are samples of their flavors. I'd love to be able to try a little bite before I pick which one I want. Although I'm guessing they all taste phenomenal. Can't wait to come back for something new!"
1583,8/20/2015,Joseph F.,fort-worth,4,Way cool and crazy inventive with the flavors!  They've really nailed it and the Popsicle's are delicious.  I got the hibiscus and I was blown away by the flavor it packed.  It was like eating hibiscus tea.  Really good!  Next time though I'e got to get a creamy one.
1584,10/27/2014,Tiffany S.,fort-worth,5,"After reading tons of reviews about Steel City, I had to check it out for myself. A friend and I grabbed lunch at AF+B right across the street and little did I know that Steel City was right there. I talked my friend into popsicles and after a brief stroll around West 7th, we found ourselves in a line out the door for a nice, cold popsicle.To say I'm a popsicle fanatic is putting it lightly. I love popsicles, especially paletas. My friend went with the buttermilk (from the ""creamy"" menu) and I decided on pomegranate. My popsicle was delicious, although it did melt quickly. The outdoor seating left a bit to be desired as it seemed like the majority of the seats were in the sun. We sat at a table with an umbrella overhead, which blocked the majority of the rays but it was still quite sunny out. Parking here is disastrous too unless you happen to be parked in the parking garage adjacent to Steel City. Lucky for me I was. All in all, this is a cool popsicle shop and I look forward to sampling a pop from the Dallas location as well."
1585,10/23/2015,Alicia J.,fort-worth,5,"Yum!I'd only spend $3 on a Popsicle here.Great service and I love the design of the shop. My favorite is the coffee and coconut.If you want something lighter, go with the clementine pop or blueberry :pI totally want a popsicle now."
1586,6/17/2016,Paulyne D.,fort-worth,4,"Steel city pops is PERFECTION. I have loved every single Popsicle from there and it's worth every penny. The lines can get long ANY time of the year but hey if you're there and you're not in a rush, EAT THESE POPSICLES. They're life changing."
1587,7/7/2016,Lauren B.,fort-worth,4,I've only been here once but I would definitely come back again. I had their buttermilk ice cream and it tasted like cheesecake! So good! Only complaint I have is the disorganization of their line to give your order. Please for the love of god fix that!
1588,6/16/2016,Karla A.,fort-worth,3,"Cute and pleasant place. Good flavors and options. However, the pops are a bit too, too sweet. I prefer more subtle flavors and to not be bombarded by sugar. I had two bites and couldn't finish it. Also, wish their creamy pops came in non-dairy options like almond or coconut milk."
1589,6/15/2016,Nydia A.,fort-worth,4,"They were sold out of half the flavors on their menu, so we just got what they had. They were delicious!!"
1590,9/2/2014,Shelly N.,fort-worth,5,"Creamy all the way! I absolutely love all the flavors that I've gotten so far. Their fruity selection is great too(blood orange is refreshing, the strawberry balsamic tastes like a salad) . Super fresh and fruity and doesn't taste artificial. My personal favorite so far has to be the buttermilk, which tastes like a cheesecake. The staff is so friendly and super knowledgeable. They can call tell you the ingredients for each pop!I can't wait for their seasonal flavors!!"
1591,8/19/2015,Miguel S.,fort-worth,4,"As with most of the new and hot places that I'm trying- it is because of my wife. If I keep this up I'm going to be 400lbs.I'm not the type to crave sweets but this place has me thinking about stoping by 2 times per week. You might think that's not bad but the drive here is about 35-40 minutes for me. The place has this cool/ chilled look.Has a couple of tables outside and inside the store they have a couple of chairs/ bar stools but with a much cooler look. Too small for me in the inside, so I rather take it to go. I know on some of the reviews the parking was an issue, well not anymore!!Across from them there is a parking garage that the first 2 hours are free. Let's talk about the goods...They are maded with all natural ingredients with no added artificial flavors or sweeteners which makes these frozen treats so good. They have some weird flavors like avocado??.. Not for me but some folks love it. For me I'm a classic man so I stick to simple flavors. One of my favorites is Caramel. I can have like 3 of these and not felt bad about it. They have a little of everything for those who like simple stuff like myself to those who like to venture into avocado pops. The prices are not too bad, about $3 or so and they have a little to go brown bag which keeps your pops frozen until you get to your destination. Pretty cool idea and it makes you worry less if you want to take some to go. Definitely will recommend this place."
1592,8/21/2014,Kimberly G.,fort-worth,5,"Fruity or Creamy? That is the question. Steel City Pops is a winner on every level. From the moment you walk in the door you are greeted by their friendly staff and your first impression is, ""Why haven't I come here sooner!?"" The digs are simple - a working kitchen where all the delicious goodness is made and a counter with freezers of your choice of fruity or creamy frozen pops. Amongst the steel (of course), wood, and great lighting, the place is immaculately clean. On a chalkboard there is an infinite list of inventive flavors like ""Hatch Lemonade"", ""Hibiscus"", and ""Cherry Sour Cream"" to name a few. We chose the ""Watermelon"" and ""Hibiscus"" fruity pops. You can taste the fresh, organic ingredients from the very first bite. The manager had even noted that he just chopped up the watermelon yesterday (awesome)! These aren't your average artificially-flavored pops. These are the kind you gobble down and get another! Steel City Pops, Welcome to the neighborhood!"
1593,7/17/2016,Rick B.,fort-worth,5,"What an innovation! No wonder there is always a line out the door. However, it moves very quickly. All sorts of flavors! Make it a mission and always try a new flavor. THE BEST IN TOWN!"
1594,7/9/2016,Windy E.,fort-worth,5,"The Watermelon pop is such a great summer treat!!!  I'm addicted, every time I go Have a new favorite flavor!!!  All time fav is chocolate, taste like frozen hot chocolate on a stick!!"
1595,12/3/2016,Treace M.,fort-worth,5,I haven't tried anything here that I haven't liked. Everything is true to the name so you better order what you really like to taste because there will be a lot of it in it.
1596,11/8/2015,Imran K.,fort-worth,4,Flavors are good. Service is quick. I just don't love paying $3.00 for a frozen Popsicle. It shows they are a very smoothly run operation.
1597,12/19/2015,Eric O.,fort-worth,5,"Super-duper creamy Popsicles that I loooove! Cookie pops are by far the best, I promise, but the rest are great too. Maple bacon bourbon sounds tempting but it may be a little too much of that flavor to want to finish it, if you know what I mean... I hope to visit some other locations ;)"
1598,9/14/2014,Mai V.,fort-worth,4,"To me, it's actually just 3.5 stars, but I will bump them up to 4 stars. After seeing so much hype about Steel City Pops from my friends in Dallas, I was really excited to find out that there was one in Fort Wort. Honestly, I'd rather just regular ice cream. Price - $3 per popsicle OR 4 popsicles for $10Store - I didn't like that there was basically only outside seating. Texas is either way too hot or way too cold, depending on the season. Items order:1. Buttermilk - this was very good at first. It had a nice sweetness and tang to it. It was almost like cheesecake. However, as I ate more and more of it, it became too sweet for me to eat. I threw away about 1/3 of it.2. Coffee - I was pleasantly surprised by this. It wasn't sickeningly sweet. Instead, it tasted like they froze creamy coffee. I wouldn't mind eating this in the morning to get my daily caffeine fix. Overall, even though I thought the pops were pretty good, I don't think I'd return. The popsicles were well made and had good flavors. I'm just not a popsicle type of person. I'd much rather go to Central Market and get their gelato (hazelnut is must try!). HOWEVER, if you love popsicles, this is definitely the place for you."
1599,10/22/2015,Jaley D.,fort-worth,5,"I don't like ice cream very much, but I love this place! I've been a few times, and we are never disappointed. I love it when the chocolate dip comes back! Last night I had smoked fig and cheese with chocolate dip. Try the cookie bars too!"
1600,2/5/2016,Jean N.,fort-worth,5,"Very hip and vibrant place! They have a refreshing/fruity selection of flavors, a coffee menu, and a creamy Popsicle menu. I would love to have tried all of them! Also, for those that love to know what goes into their bodies, all the calories are listed next to the flavor, which is excellent and convenient. It was pretty crowded even on cold days, but service is so quick. Highly recommend you check this place out!"
1601,9/8/2014,James P.,fort-worth,5,"So many reviews.... I guess tl;dr then. They sell only popsicles. Obviously. They're three bucks a pop. Parking is tricky. Park in the street. No garages unless you want to pay. Finding the place is also tricky if you're not used to the area. Luckily their store name is laid out in giant metal letters. Flavors are divided between creamy and fruity. Creamy would be like vanilla or coffee. Fruity would be like orange or watermelon. They run out of specific flavors form time to time. For example, they were out of blood orange the other day. The flavors also change from time to time. Rotating or seasonal would be one way to put it. Finally, these are the best popsicles you'll ever have. If they're not, please let me know what you have been eating because I really want to try some too."
1602,10/25/2015,Tony L.,fort-worth,3,"Fresh and tastes fine, but I'm still a little puzzled why it has so much hype. The best part about this is that they use fresh ingredients.. which is frozen into a $3 popsicle... I had the Caramel and Cranberry Orange - neither made me want to come back. But I'll try other flavors and see if my opinion of this place changes. Seating is pretty limited. Especially indoor, so I was forced outside to find a seat. I made the mistake of coming on a hot day, so it melted in my hands before I could even finish."
1603,8/3/2015,Lydia S.,fort-worth,5,"Yes! Yes! Yes! 5 Stars! Steel City Pops is so refreshing, delicious, and adorable. I do not know how or why it took me so long to finally try it out! It will definitely be a new go-to for all mydessert needs. I enjoyed the coffee popsicle. It was hands down the best coffee flavored dessert I have ever had. It was so creamy and scrumptious. My husband had the vanilla popsicle and he was just as impressed. It was so good in fact that before we left we just HAD to try a popsicle from the ""fruity"" side of the menu board. We shared the cucumber lime and it was so cold and refreshing. Perfect summer treat for a 100 degree Fort Worth day. Great customer service as well from the two young ladies behind the counter. We will be back... I can't wait to try the blueberry basil!!!"
1604,10/17/2015,Amy O.,fort-worth,4,"I LOVE the popsicles but the staff aren't that great. There's one girl who is particularly rude. It's such a bummer because with the volume of people they have coming in for treats, you'd think they could afford good workers. The line is usually out the door but it goes pretty quickly. Parking can be a little tricky though on busy nights---don't waste your time looking for a street spot, head right into the West 7th garage.As far as the popsicles go, its really nice that they trade out flavors based on season and now they've added the option to dip your popsicle in chocolate. I just wish they'd offer dark chocolate in addition to milk!"
1605,9/14/2015,Karrie I.,fort-worth,5,I can't tell you enough how much I love Steel City Pops! What an ingenious & novel idea! Flavors are out of this world! This place is a big winner in my book.
1606,7/13/2014,Vi N.,fort-worth,4,"Love the giant sign in front. The patio is a nice area. Inside is tiny but service goes pretty quick and friendly. My friend ordered hibiscus. If you over boil hibiscus, it will be bitter. Her popsicle was refreshing! Not too tart, not too sweet. She says well done. Hers was my favorite. I ordered avocado because they were out of most of my first choices (coconut, watermelon, blood orange). It was creamy and didn't really have a strong avocado flavor. It was good though. My special friend was highly disappointed there was no coconut, guava nor strawberry, which were all out, so he ordered coffee and they said that just ran out, so he ordered lemonade, which basically tastes like a Lemon Chill. The popsicle stuck to the wrapper and didn't come off as easily as the other two so his theory is that lemonade is a reject flavor that doesn't get chosen so it's old. I said he's just a grump. We arrived around 8:00 P.M. I would come back earlier in the day to try the flavors I wanted and make sure someone orders hibiscus so I can have a bite."
1607,8/12/2014,Lara S.,fort-worth,4,"Almost too many flavors to choose from! The menu is divided between fruity and creamy. I went with Caramel, which was delicious. Avocado, I'm coming for you next! Definitely a great spot to enjoy a treat. $3 a pop seems a bit pricey, but what do I know."
1608,5/6/2016,Andrew V.,fort-worth,4,"The lavender lemonade was alright, but the strawberry balsamic was great. Really neat flavor combinations."
1609,8/1/2014,Mia T.,fort-worth,5,"Although the parking situation is terrible around this area, it's worth the effort to try one of their Popsicles. We were greeted by the cutest young guy who launched into how everything worked in their store. The choices are extensive but I finally managed to pick coffee and my bf had blood orange. When trying to tip, we were told they aren't allowed to accept them?! The store and outdoor space are beautiful and we took a few minutes to sit outside and eat. For those who live in the area, they have a buy 10 get 1 free punch card."
1610,7/23/2014,Jenny Y.,fort-worth,5,"So delicious! I've been here twice already in the past week.  This is a pretty unique concept, as most of the gourmet frozen treats are geared towards ice cream.  The flavors are definitely one of a kind, and are categorized by sweet or creamy.  The only downside is that you aren't able to sample them to make sure you like the flavor, but there isn't really a good way to do this, so it's understandable.  Plus at only 3 dollars a pop, it won't really break your bank to try some new flavors and branch out.They don't validate parking so be sure to get your ticket validated elsewhere after or park on the street :)(This isn't their fault, as they said that they have attempted to get in on the list of businesses that allow parking validation in the garages nearby and were denied)"
1611,8/9/2015,Le E.,fort-worth,5,"I've tried the watermelon recently which tastes exactly like watermelon. Nothing artificial tasting here. The consistency of the pops are great, not icy or grainy. Strawberries and cream is delicious too. My husband tired the one with a cookie and said it was tasty too. I will be back to try every flavor. It's that good. There's nothing like it in Fort Worth."
1612,7/13/2015,Somchai I.,fort-worth,5,"coffee is the way to go my fellow yelpers! and if you arent watching your weight, coffee with a brownie. holy balls this was so good and i shouldnt of eat it because well i should watch what i eat but i did not care! hahahamy only complaints about this place is the way it way it was built, the flow of incoming outgoing people just creates chaos. and sitting outside is great but the dumpster smell 10ft away just makes me gag on the smell and not my ice cream hahaha. eating ice cream is so awkward hahahah watching 30 people do it HAHAHHAHA. but anywho i love this place."
1613,4/12/2016,Evyn S.,fort-worth,5,"I am obsessed with this place. I used to live in Fort Worth and every time I come back to visit, I make a point to come here. On my most recent visit I had the creamy orange one and it was amazing. The coffee is always great and the not creamy ones are awesome as well. Someone please start one in Denver Colorado!!!!"
1614,3/27/2016,Emily D.,fort-worth,5,"great place to visit with your friends on a hot sunny day! its pops are amazingly delicious and has a variety of flavors. some seasonal flavors are often available too. my favorites are the creamy buttermilk and the fruity raspberry lemon. the pops are $3 each, teeshirts are often out of styles or desired colors though. but overall the pops are great."
1615,3/26/2016,Nicholas M.,fort-worth,4,"I tripped and it seems 50% of people trip on the curb and catch themselves on the front door. This provides endless entertainment while eating the tasty pops. An old lady almost bit the dust, which wasn't funny, but the rest were hilarious :)"
1616,4/13/2015,Luci P.,fort-worth,5,I love going and seeing what seasonal flavored they have! So fresh and is so fun to watch them make them.
1617,1/20/2015,Samn R.,fort-worth,2,"Ah. You guys know that there are these men, especially in Fort Worth, pushing carts on their bikes, sometimes even walking, that have way better popsicles than what you get here? And they are priced less, practically hand delivered. So you don't get fancy flavors like Rum raisin, or spruce (isn't that a Christmas tree?), and it can't be dipped in chocolate, but I haven't had a single popsicle here that I've completed eating because it wasn't freezer burnt. None of the flavors I've had were impressive. Rum raisin, pistachio, strawberry, divinity, coffee, vanilla bean, and other fancy stuff I can't remember... I'm not gonna lie, I was initially impressed when I first visited the one in Dallas. After a couple of follow up visits to this location, I realized I was wasting my money. It's a trendy little popsicle shop at best. Support the guy rolling through your hood. He probably makes $3 an hour just trying to get those popsicles to you. And if you don't have 'em rolling through your hood, I guess a drive on over to Steel City will serve its purpose. Or you could add $2 to that and get a whole box of Dreyer's fruit bars from the grocery store. Support a corporation. Go big, or stay home!"
1618,5/31/2015,Von B.,fort-worth,5,Why haven't I reviewed this place?! It's pretty hipster but I don't mind it because I love them Popsicles! Every time I come here I would buy 2-4 of the pop bags to take home. And when you do get the bags it's nice because they would put ice packs in there just in case so it eases my mind. I dragged my parents and brother in here recently and they didn't understand why I was so obsessed. Once they took their first bite they were hooked! The coffee flavor is very nice and rich you even get the coffee ground in there. My favorite right now is the pineapple! Taste just like you're eating a sweet pineapple on the stick it's so refreshing for summer. The mango is delicious! Cucumber lime is refreshing as well you get a lot of a cucumber taste which I like. Cantaloupe is very nice and not overly sweet. The vanilla bean is rich and creamy but melts a lot faster that the fruity flavors. I also love how they do change out the flavors so it keeps me always on my toes!
1619,3/20/2016,Yalile R.,fort-worth,5,"The american version of a paleteria....great flavors, tried the coconut - like biting into one...they have a great selection of water and milk based pops.  Please bring back the chocolate dipped pops!!!!"
1620,1/5/2015,Jennifer L.,fort-worth,2,"I was excited when they opened one up in Ft.Worth since it was near my work, so I went to go try it out to see what the hype was all about. I tried the strawberry after a recommendation from a friend, but it honestly just tasted like the dryers fruit bars I could get from the grocery store...a $3 pop to taste something as generic as that is pretty pricey. On top of that, my friend stood up to get back in line to buy some to go for herself, and the cashier's friend walked into the store and cut in front of my friend. The cashier and her friend talked for at least 5 minutes after that girl got her pop, while my friend kept standing behind her waiting to order. Terrible customer service!! I'll give this place some stars for the nice decor but I highly doubt I'll be back"
1621,4/3/2015,Rashell M.,fort-worth,5,I love this place what a great business idea. These owners should open some more locations they'd do great. I've tried lemon and also carrot cake a seasonal flavor both were fabulous. I'll continue to frequent this business. Only wish parking lot in front of business would allow customers to park in it. The gates were closed.
1622,8/21/2014,Stephen W.,fort-worth,4,"Very fun and for $3 you can't go wrong, plus they have a 4 for $10 to go special with a special bag.I got the strawberry which was good, but next time I'll try one of the creamy ones since the strawberry was so dense."
1623,12/10/2014,Nini N.,fort-worth,4,"Pretty good pops right here. But watch out, they melt really quick! The employee there is also very bleh? I don't know. It seems like he didn't like his work so much.I got divinity which is delicious. I would go again and again and again!"
1624,7/5/2015,Leann K.,fort-worth,5,This was delicious!!! First time here. I had the vanilla bean pop. Real vanilla bean ice cream on a stick. It was so good! I plan to go back and try a fruity flavor very soon! I also loved that they had the calories written next to each flavor for those of us who are usually a little more health conscious.

Updated review",David V.,fort-worth,4,"Tried some more Popsicles leaving completely satisfied this time:-) the vanilla and chocolate chip cookie Popsicle was the best. The parking situation has seemed to change a bit. You get 2 hours free in the garage, which is plenty of time:-)"
1626,10/3/2016,Lindsay H.,fort-worth,5,"Great atmosphere and wonderful flavors to choose from! I love that their not overly priced and it's a good change up from the typical go-to desserts. I've only been a couple of times, but I'll definitely be going back to try all their flavors."
1627,12/14/2015,Lan N.,fort-worth,4,Love the exotic flavors they have for their Popsicles. They recently added the brownie/cake in their Popsicles and that's a favorite. I enjoy this place in the summer and winter because of their seasonal flavors. I prefer fruity flavors and they do match up to their flavors.
1628,3/16/2016,Teresa N.,fort-worth,4,"These tasty popsicles are great on a warm/ hot day! I love fruits so I've tried most of their fruity flavors like their cucumber lime, pineapple jalapeno, hibiscus, and raspberry lemon. They're all SO refreshing with a pop of flavor, and they're the perfect amount of sweetness! Maybe next time I'll venture out and try the creamy flavors. I'm sure those are just as good! You could even take it togo, and they'll put it in a neat package that will keep the popsicles cool. Furthermore, the service was quick, the workers were friendly, and the place was clean. They also have a patio outside to sit and enjoy the weather. Parking was easy as well, as there is a free 2-hour parking garage right next to it. What's not to like? It's great for both kids and adults!"
1629,2/26/2015,Keitha S.,fort-worth,4,"I'm a big fan of this place. This inside is cute, the patio is cute, the big sign outside is cute. The popsicles, both fruity and creamy, are delightful. I had the cherry sour cream and avocado and oh my goodness!! I've been with friends who have had peanut butter, banana, chocolate and obviously had to steal a bite and those flavors were great as well. I haven't tried it yet, but I love that they partnered with a local bakery to create cookie pops. Hopefully they taste as amazing as they look!"
1630,1/26/2015,Larry S.,fort-worth,5,"Took my daughter last weekend and we tried 4 flavors, and they were all delish.My favorite was the Buttermilk, which I never would have tried except for other Yelpers before me who recommended it.  It was awesome !! Like a buttermilk pie/cheesecake converted to a frozen delight.  That one will get a repeat buy.We also had the coconut, the chocolate, and a strawberry.The server told me the Blueberry Cream is a popular flavor and I will get one of those next time.No freezer burn on any of ours, by the way.  Daughter is anxious to go back, and we will, soon, and stock up !!"
1631,2/9/2015,Danny C.,fort-worth,5,"This place couldn't be any better!  Specifically the coffee brownie is to kill for, the strawberry tasted so fresh and marvellous... I want... nay, I need more. Now!!"
1632,3/15/2016,Susan S.,fort-worth,5,"OMG- so far my favorite is coconut, avocado, mango is good too, D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!"
1633,8/25/2016,Anonymous F.,fort-worth,5,"My friend took me here when i visited Fort Worth for the first time, it was a hot evening, and the popsicle was so good and refreshing.  I believe I had the seasonal blood orange and my friend had vanilla chocolate chip cookie which really had cookie in it!! I never thought popsicle can make such popular and successful business.  It was pretty pricey for popsicle, but it tastes great!"
1634,9/22/2014,Minh N.,fort-worth,4,"A perfect sweet treat to end your date! I love that it's in a cute trendy little area with a ton of dining spot. I walked here after dinner and it's in an adorable little shop. Amazingly refreshing and I can't wait to try all the flavors! I've tried the blood orange (very refreshing and mildly sweet) the strawberry balsamic (it's like a kick to your taste buds with the vinegar and sweet strawberry mix) the buttermilk (which I LOOOOOVE) and the coffee (which I also love! I think it tastes like vietnamese coffee, cafe sua da) The texture of the pops are amazing, I love how the creamy flavors are soooooooo smooth and nice really icy at all but you can still crunch the pops in your mouth. It's hard to explain, just try it out and see!"
1635,8/17/2015,Robin P.,fort-worth,1,"The pops were pretty good, but nothing to write home about. We had the Buttermilk & Strawberry Lemonade. The shop itself & the lack of pride in the establishment will keep me from returning for another. Reasons for the poor review:1. Little to no space indoors. Cramped quarters on a Hot August day is not an inviting environment. 2. VERY little shade outside....if you have a shop serving cold treats, no one wants to stand/sit in the Texas August sun sweating to death. Invest in SHADE! The minimal cost to shade the patio area would boost business tremendously in the hot summer months. 3. Cleanliness was sorely lacking. Every table outside was filthy. No one ever came out to wash down tables, pickup trash, or just check on their customers. There was trash everywhere including Popsicle sticks, dirty napkins, and melted Popsicles on the ground.Great concept that has been poorly executed!!"
1636,4/3/2015,Chris A.,fort-worth,5,"This place is great! We've tried the coffee, coconut, cucumber lime, and coffee with brownie. They're all great. I wish there was one back home :(It's also really interesting to watch them make the pops."
1637,8/2/2015,Scott C.,fort-worth,5,"First time here, came with work team.  Everyone loved it.  I had the avocado pop which was awesome.  Will be back!"
1638,7/25/2016,Robert H.,fort-worth,5,"We tried this place with the family. It is a little place, hidden a round' the corner. We tried the fruit filled pops, homemade, like they said. They were a little pricey, but they were good. I tried the strawberry lemonade; my wife had the chocolate crime. It started raining, in the middle of us eating!! In August!! Will have to try it again!"
1639,7/18/2015,Isabel H.,fort-worth,5,"Came for the first time and there are just so many flavors to try!Got the strawberry lemonade and it was so good!!This place is a must try if you want a good popsicle. If they're going to open another one, they need to open up one in Austin because they would do so well!"
1640,10/1/2014,Brian F.,fort-worth,5,"This is actually really cool.  Aside from puns and stuff.After an afternoon filled with sweat, beer, and burgers at Fred's, we noticed that the place across the street actually has something in it now.  And it's popsicles.  It was an obvious choice of things to do after sitting on a patio in the heat.  Good decision!Fruit and Cream sides on the flavor wall.  Blueberry Basil was really good.  I was stoked about the blueberry.  I mean, most of the time a blueberry popsicle has a strange off-purple color to it and has no relation to the flavor of a blueberry, but this is actually made with berries, apparently.  The only kicker was the basil.  What a weird combo.  You know what?  I was fine.  Actually, it was really good.So was the lemon.  So was the coffee.The coffee was super good."
1641,12/6/2014,Emily F.,fort-worth,5,"This place is what dreams are made of. Out of all of the flavors I've tried (most of the summer and fall & I'm getting through the winter now) there has only been one that I haven't liked (plum). The quality and flavor of these pops are unparalleled. While $3 may seen a little steep for a popsicle, they are worth it in every way. My go-to flavors are avocado (summer), buttermilk (all seasons/tastes like cheesecake), blood orange(summer), sweet potato (fall), and chocolate mint (winter).Steel City will quickly become a favorite desert spot!"
1642,9/20/2014,Heather L.,fort-worth,5,"It's just popsicles. How can popsicles possibly get five stars? Let me tell you... My husband claims dessert lately ""has no flavor"" I have been trying out various places on him determined to change that and continuously get met with shrugs and ""yeah, it is okay"". Melt ice cream (which I liked, hello ghost pepper ice cream!) didn't even register a shrug from him! So I didn't hold out much hope for Steel City Pops. In fact when I suggested it I got an eyeroll and a ""popsicles? really?"" After a very tasty dinner at Thirteen Pies we took a short lovely little stroll around the corner to this shop. It is cute! It is very small and open and I got to see them making the popsicles. This was a Monday night and they were pretty busy, so I can imagine on the weekend this place has a good line. We went in and perused their menu, they have a creamy half and a fruity half and everything sounded good. Sweet tea popsicles? Buttermilk, blueberry basil! I love weird. They will run you $3 per popsicle or 4 popsicles for $10. I finally went with a cherry sour cream and hubs picked chocolate. We went outside to the very cute little courtyard, it has four tables, some benches and lovely string lights, and it was rather quiet, which was just perfect on this 72 degree night to sit and relax and enjoy our treats. I tasted mine, and WOW! I loved it. Creamy, thick, sweet and little chunks of cherry bits. I looked over at the hubby and...he was... smiling! YES! VICTORY IS MINE! He said he is impressed, admitted he was wrong. He said it was rich and sweet, but not too sweet, balanced. So we sat and enjoyed the night. As we were leaving he said let's come back here soon. So you, my dear Steel City Pops, earned five stars for: your delicious popsicles which feature the unusual and the usual flavors to satisfy all tastes, making the husband happy, giving me a victory, your friendly register girls, being open to 10, being a simple and well executed idea, and for your little tucked away spot to sit and enjoy them.  We will be back soon to try more flavors!"
1643,2/20/2015,Ann L.,fort-worth,4,"Despite the fact they were closing in 10 minutes, people were still coming in, and people who were already there still chatted while eating their pops. I've heard of this place so many times and have been meaning to try it.. Finally the chance has come! And the fact that there are still customers before closing is a good sign. It probably was obvious I was new, since I was staring blankly at the menu. The guy before the counter was nice enough to explain the difference between the two boards. As I asked if I could get it to go, he said of course! Even better! I grabbed the strawberry, vanilla with chips, and cucumber lime. It was worth it! I bought the strawberry one for my daughter and she finished it within minutes. I first ate the cucumber lime and it was so fresh. Definitely going back to try more ""daring"" flavors. Happy the pops doesn't melt as quickly as they should."
1644,7/1/2016,Tonya V.,fort-worth,5,Delicious!!! Long line but moved very quickly. Lots of options! Very sweet & helpful staff. I loved the calorie information being posted beside each flavor.
1645,8/20/2015,Liz S.,fort-worth,5,"This place is so fun!! All the flavors are good, but my favorite are the coffee & vanilla bean!!"
1646,8/9/2014,Nathan P.,fort-worth,5,"For $3 on the nose, you can get an outstandingly flavorful and cold dessert at Steel City Pops. You have an option in selecting from multiple fruity flavors or multiple cream based flavors. The buttermilk pop tastes like a frozen piece of cheesecake and the sour cream cherry has a tartness that goes well with the sweetness of the cream.  This place is right across the street from the original Fred's off of W 7th, so parking is street based or you have to park in the garage. The only seating is outdoors but if you go early evening the building is situated so that the sun is blocked."
1647,5/31/2015,Tori R.,fort-worth,5,I went here a while back ago but I decided to write a review. Okay so I went on a wednesday around 2. I love  the variety of popsicles they have and they all taste very natural.  I recommend the strawberry  pop if you love  fruity flavors.  also most popsicles are only $3 (the ones with cookies and brownies are $1.50 more :-) I also went back another time and I got the strawberry lemonade popsicle and pineapple they were both amazing and great summer flavors
1648,7/12/2014,Lauren N.,fort-worth,4,"This is such a cute addition to this area! Tucked across the street from Fred's burgers and behind Bonnel Waters is the new pop shop. They offer both fruit based and cream based Popsicles. We tried to come opening night, but without a dedicated parking area, this place is hard to visit. There are plenty of parking garages, but the parking attendants will not allow you to park in them if you say you are going to steel city. I found this very strange, considering you can pay to park in the garage. So good luck finding a spot on the street when you feel that sweet tooth kick in! I tried the avocado and the man friend got the cherry sour cream. I really liked mine- not a very strong avocado taste. It was mostly a creamy lime flavor. The cherry sour cream was delicious! I definitely preferred that one. It had a tart cherry flavor balanced nicely by the cream. You can get your pops and enjoy them inside where they have lots of fans or out on the shady patio at a table. They also offer small insulated bags with your purchase if you plan on eating the pops later. I enjoyed our visit and I know I'll be back to work my way around the menu. Hopefully I won't have to fight for parking!!!"
1649,1/5/2015,Solomon W.,fort-worth,5,"A sucker for old food concepts done new, I enjoy critiquing quality when an institution attempts to take on such an endeavor. Basically, I am pretty black and white on the ways that I evaluate and probe these sorts of shops.And Steel City Pops exceeds all sorts of presuppositions regarding ""fancy popsicles."" In fact, they do so without even really doing anything too crazy.Some of it is the attention to detail--see the ice packs, Styrofoam containers, and neatness of packing. Other bonuses come about from the philanthropic ideals--promoting and supporting water supplies.But the popsicles continually win me over, likely on account of the seasonal or new flavors, most recently pumpkin pie (around Thanksgiving, of course) and blueberry cream.Oh, and the pricing isn't eye-gouging when you consider the discount for 4+ as well as the punch card..."
1650,2/7/2015,Sara W.,fort-worth,5,AWESOME!!! Three bucks of heaven!The line was out the door but it did not take long at all. There is nice outside seating once you get your pop to hang out.
1651,6/10/2015,Angelica L.,fort-worth,4,"I cannot get enough of this place! I frequent the Dallas location, but this was my first time visiting the FW location. I came here with my boyfriend and his parents after din yesterday and the weather was perfect for a good ol' pop! I got the creamy coconut and the others tried coffee and caramel. They were all amazing and full of rich flavor. At $3 a pop you're definitely not getting short handed in the flavor department, they are certainly worth every penny! They have frequent buyer cards as well for those of us lookin' for a deal! The line is usually pretty lengthy, but don't let that deter you, it moves extremely fast. They have indoor and outdoor seating with shade. The reason I gave four stars was bc the parking is pretty scant in front of the store, and you have to play a little Tetris to get in and out."
1652,10/2/2014,Lex W.,fort-worth,3,"Steel City, oh Steel City! Cool, minimalist place to go for fancy ice pops. One of the chalkboards lists milk based pops, the other water-based pops. All are grown-up, foodie type flavors, like cherry sour cream, coffee, blueberry basil, and blood orange. I've tried the blood orange and coffee ones, both which were really good. I knocked off a star for two reasons--one, there is no parking around Steel City--but I guess that's not really their fault. And two, while the idea of gourmet pops is fun, it's not the first time they've been around--paleta people have been selling them in their dry ice carts for forever!!!!"
1653,9/4/2014,Jennifer W.,fort-worth,4,"At first when I heard about this place, I was all, ""Seriously? A store *just* for popsicles?"" But, then I thought a bit... well, we have ice-cream shops, so why not a popsicle shop? That thought, paired with a day off, had me on my way.First: Parking. (-.5 star) - Maybe it's just me, but super-confusing parking situation. There's what appears to be an open lot right outside, but it's gated, and I tend to think it's for the Fixi-Shop next door. Then, there's the garage *right* behind it, but: (1) The entrance to it looks like a one-way (out) or an alley - not apparent what it is as you drive past; (2) when you do go into the garage, there's a sign saying that it's *not* parking for Steel City Pops as well as a few other establishments which are apparently not part of West 7th Shops. So: you need to find parking on the street. This means walking. In the hot sun. While eating a popsicle. (That is, if you don't want to hang around their shop or patio.) Or, maybe I missed something and parking is super-easy. Color me blind.That diatribe aside, the one pop I've had so far was delicious. Coconut. Creamy, delicious coconut frozeness. These pops are hefty - $3 even after tax, and a bargain, if you ask me. Look at MELT over on the Southside - a local ice cream shop. Super good, but a single scoop (and a small one by comparison to what we're used to at other places) in a waffle cone runs $4.75; you're done with it in 5 minutes. Or, even my former fave food-truck, Red Jett Sweets, at $3 a cupcake, you'd be done in 20 seconds (but, OMG, they were so tasty!).A Steel City Pop? $3 for a good 10-15 minutes of awesome. (Yes, I just put value on how long a frozen goodie takes to eat.)If you're not into the creamy variety, fruit ones are in abundance. If you see ""x"" next to the flavor you're contemplating, they're all out. I liked my one pop so much, I stopped by a few days later to pick up a 4-pack (a relative bargain at $10). I have yet to indulge, as I'm waiting for the right moment to sink my teeth into either: Buttermiilk, Coffee, Cucumber Lime, or ... I forget the other fruity."
1654,8/21/2014,Brandon K.,fort-worth,4,"Outstanding Spot in the cracks of West 7th! You must visit this spot when walking downtown. Get there early while they still have all of the popular flavors.  Prices are not too bad for the quality. They make them on the spot and can see them scooping out fresh ingredients. Only disappointment was that they don't validate. They say you have to walk a couple blocks down to a company that they said validates for them, so plan on visiting another validation spot before going here. I got my punch card because I will be back!"
1655,11/3/2014,Ann H.,fort-worth,4,A perfect and light dessert after a big dinner. Some of the creamy flavors will remind you of ice cream while some have the tartness that comes from frozen yogurt. The fruity flavors will remind you of the thousands of grocery store popsicles you would eat as a child but made much yummier for the grown up you.
1656,7/26/2014,Pastor Steve D.,fort-worth,5,Wow! These aren't the popsicles you used to get from chasing the ice cream truck. Gourmet and scrumptious. The pineapple jalapeño will mess with your mind. Sweet then spicy. I love jalapeños but it was a bit too much. The banana was great and the lemonade was refreshing. For $3 bucks a pop including tax who can complain?!?  Just amazing!My favs... Cherry Sour Cream and Avocado!
1657,11/13/2014,Blake C.,fort-worth,4,"Our family has stopped by Steel City Pops at least six times over the past three months. My wife had a hankering for anything cold and refreshing while she was pregnant, so understandably, Steel City Pops became a real ""hot"" spot for us. I have to say, I enjoy their Summer flavors far more than their fall flavors. But you can still pick up a Strawberry Pop, so I go for that one. I'm really looking forward to seeing what they roll out this Winter, as I'm a bit of a Christmas freak. You can catch them at the Food Truck Parks on occasion as well, which is where we first found them. The owners are wonderful people who gave my wife her Pop for free when their credit card machine failed. We returned later in the day with Cash because they were entirely too kind. If you're in Fort Worth and you're looking for a sweet and light treat, Steel City Pops belongs on that short list of places you must go."
1658,8/24/2014,Lisa P.,fort-worth,5,Love the vanilla Bean and the strawberry balsamic. Very funGreat atmosphere lots of friendly staff. The bloode orange and the peach rock!!
1659,8/23/2014,Thang S.,fort-worth,2,Not sure what's so great about these. Got the strawberry balsamic and the blueberry. They weren't mind blowing. I want my mind blown.
1660,11/26/2014,Paola L.,fort-worth,5,"Why would anyone give this place less than 5 stars?!It is delicious. And yes i know its a perfect white girl cliché. My favorites are Hibiscus, Arnold Palmer, Strawberry Basil, and Blood Orange. (I have a preference for water based ones. But he others are just as good)They have a good policy where if you don't like the flavor you picked out, you can switch for another one!"
1661,8/10/2014,Shannon S.,fort-worth,4,"I am normally a chocolate loyalist, but I strongly prefer the fruit popsicles here. Don't get me wrong, the chocolate, coffee, caramel, and other creamy pops are delicious and leave your lips all satin-y. But, the strawberry, lemonade, blood orange, and pineapple pops are otherworldly. They have a great ratio of tartness and sweetness, and I couldn't dream of a more refreshing treat in the Texas heat. We took ours home in the freezer bags, and they stayed frozen and perfect during our 10 mile trip home."
1662,6/19/2015,Linda D.,fort-worth,5,"let me just start off by saying - I don't really like ice cream. I hardly ever eat it. but when I tried the brownie ice cream - OMGAH. Delicious. You need to try this. The creamy ice cream tends to taste a lot better to me than the others. It's popsicles, not much I can say about it but just get up and go get yourself one."
1663,5/31/2015,Lanchi P.,fort-worth,3,"3.5 stars because I'm not quite sure what the craze is all about...cue the angry yelp mob but...it's just popsicles.  They are tasty, but a little overpriced for frozen juice.  The first time I tried Steel City, it was in Dallas (lower Greenville location) and I got avocado, not knowing it wasn't true avocado.  I think it had lime in it also, but it only advertised as avocado.  I hated it.  Fast forward to today, hanging out in Ft Worth with some friends and we end up at Steel City for dessert.  I got guava, and it was very refreshing and not too sweet.  Between us, we also got mint/green tea, vanilla bean, and strawberry cream.  The mint/green tea combo has no hint of green tea, and was overpowered completely by mint.  The creamy varieties, vanilla bean and strawberry cream were delicious.  Very, very creamy and decadent.  All in all, I enjoyed my popsicle while it lasted, but I wouldn't say I'd go out of my way to come back, only because the novelty alone doesn't blow me away enough to shell out $3 for one.  PS- I do looooove and appreciate the fact that they list out the calories next to each flavor on the menu board!  Very helpful for those of us trying to make more health conscious choices."
1664,8/16/2014,Thy T.,fort-worth,4,"Pretty cool that they make their own popsicles right there in the store. I hope they're able to provide free parking spots in the garage because if I wasn't in the area already, I would probably give up and not bother trying to find a parking spot. Onto the flavours, my favorite one definitely have to be the coffee one. Had it several times and they were all consistent. I also tried the vanilla and orange one and they were both good. I was disappointed with the avocado one because I thought it was going to be creamier. It tasted more like lime. Overall, great place to hang out with friends and eat popsicles in the blazing hot summer!"
1665,6/4/2015,Alan M.,fort-worth,3,"Ok, but not great. Perhaps I need to try other flavors, but Popsicles are really not my cut of tea.Although, at 10pm their was a lot of people lined up, so they are doing something right."
1666,11/12/2015,Amy A.,fort-worth,5,I had my first experience and loved it. The cranberry orange was fresh and tasty. I'll definitely be back to try more!
1667,8/18/2015,Kevin N.,fort-worth,4,I prefer ice cream but fancy pops work too. Parking is horrid nowadays. I can't blame them. Avoid the busy hours and lick like mad! They melt quick in this heat.
1668,8/29/2015,Kat I.,fort-worth,4,"This place is delicious! The avocado pop was okay. I love the atmosphere and looking forward to the fruity pops. I didn't like having to find parking but I'm pretty sure there's a free parking lot. Plus, it's near a bunch of restaurants so save your dessert for Steel City."
1669,7/27/2014,Michael G.,fort-worth,5,Such a great place for the summer!! I went here for dessert after eating across the street and had the Avocado Popsicle. It was super creamy and sweet! It also had a hint of lime juice which was a great addition for flavor! I tried the banana as well which featured Mexican cinnamon and was good too!
1670,7/31/2015,Erica M.,fort-worth,5,"This place is delicious! I would eat one everyday if I wouldn't feel guilty about it.  I had the vanilla bean pop.  It was so good.  Next time I go, I feel like I am going to have to get one of the cookie pops. (ice cream with cookie pieces) This is a great place to take your kids when its a scorcher in fort worth."
1671,4/2/2016,Deborah L.,fort-worth,5,Love this place!! My favorite...when they have it.....is Chocolate Chili!!!! But Cucumber & Lime is always a good choice
1672,7/4/2015,Treeca R.,fort-worth,5,Nice and friendly environment... Like the fact that I could also have my ice cream served in a cone.
1673,7/6/2015,Mehdi D.,fort-worth,4,Great variety and had to see what the hype was all about. Was really good but a lil pricey for a Popsicle.
1674,8/10/2015,Elizabeth B.,fort-worth,5,Why didn't I think of this?! $2.95 for Popsicles and many are gourmet. I had Hibiscus and I can't wait to go back and try some of the cream ones!
1675,3/22/2015,Paul N.,fort-worth,4,"Always new flavors depending on the season. I love the vibe in there. Kind of hipsterish. Reminded me of Denton. :) They have a variety of flavors up on the board behind them categorized Fruity or Creamy. I prefer the creamy side better because of the coconut flavor! D-E-L-I-S-H! I am drooling as i am typing this. I'd recommend this place to anybody taking their significant other out on a date. Not just because it's a cool place, but because the popsicles are so good you are too busy devouring it and forget to talk to one another. Think of it as a break from each other to think of more topics to talk about afterwards :P"
1676,7/18/2015,Jeanette R.,fort-worth,3,"I've been wanting to try this place for a while now, I can say it's not worth the hype. You can make these at home easily, it's overall okay. You should at least come here once for the experience."
1677,7/17/2015,Madisynn M.,fort-worth,5,"YUM!!! My cousin works here so my family stopped in while she was working the front. Boy am I glad we did! The pops were great, the atmosphere wonderful, workers friendly, and parking free :) I'm not a coffee drinker but if all coffee tasted like how my coffee pop did, I would drink it all the time! The rest of my family got piña colada, avocado, cucumber lime, and passionfruit. They were all delicious and had a great texture. They have tons of flavors that all sound great so I really don't think you can go wrong. Definitely recommend! Wish they had Steel a City Pops in my town!"
1678,5/5/2015,Pokai M.,fort-worth,4,"Expensive popsicles but I would say they are worth it once in a while. I much prefer the creamy side over the fruity side, especially that buttermilk one! I dont feel like their fruity flavors match their descriptions and very much lacking the fruit. The mango one tasted peachy and the cantaloupe one tasted like lime. But i could eat the buttermilk one or the coffee one all day long."
1679,6/15/2015,Elbey B.,fort-worth,4,Neat concept. Brilliant marketing. Incredible business. Would recommend and would come back.
1680,6/8/2015,Iris G.,fort-worth,5,"I'm never disappointed at Steel City. I love trying a new flavor every time, but my favorite has to be the Mayhaw popsicle! Staff is great and very knowledgeable about their flavors."
1681,7/27/2015,LN H.,fort-worth,5,"$3 a pop with fun creamy or fruit flavors. You can watch them make the popsicles and see every step in  production. I had buttermilk which is like cheesecake and my sister had avocado which was lemony. Our friend had banana which was also good. Basically a hip, cool version of the paleterias, Mexican ice cream parlors. Quick and fast to get good ice cream. Very fun."
1682,6/17/2015,Rebecca K.,fort-worth,5,"Yummo! Had the vanilla pop. Was yummy! I had the Orange green tea pop too, but it was too sweet for me. I'll try something different next time."
1683,7/12/2015,Wills H.,fort-worth,5,"Went to steel city pops today and we got the coffee, cantaloupe, and chocolate brownie pops. Chocolate brownie was delicious. Coffee and cantaloupe were not as good. Clay helped us and was very good with his suggestions as well as customer service. Thank you clay!!!!!"
1684,10/20/2014,Jack H.,fort-worth,4,"I've heard of lots of specialty desserts places , cakes, pies , cupcakes, but this is a first for a whole place dedicated to popsicles. Why wouldn't  you open a shop just for some delicious frozen treats? Located in one of the best spots , 7th has so much to offer, finding a fun place like Steel city pops only adds to the charm. With crazy flavors like Arnold Palmer, pumpkin, pineapple jalapeño and many more. They have tradition flavors to for the not so daring. I had plum and my wife had rhubarb. Both full of flavor, with the perfect amount of sweetness. You can buy them individually or by the box. It was a delicious treat for a warm Saturday afternoon. I would like to see more flavors, and less weird and more tasty. I guess I'm not daring  enough to try a corn bread flavored popsicle . Maybe I will be more adventurous next time!"
1685,5/13/2015,FW Foodie T.,fort-worth,4,This place is amazing!  Who thought you would find a line to get Popsicles on a Thursday night?  The selections are a bit overwhelming for a first timer.  We had a group and each person tried a different flavor.  I selected the Vanilla Chocolate Chip and to my surprise there was a cookie in the center of my popsicle - Heaven!  It was scrumptious!  I could have eaten another.  The only complaint in our group was half way through the Mango Popsicle the eater said it tasted like a potato - no real flavor.  Maybe just an off night?  They also offer a container that allows you to take up to 12 popsicles home to your freezer!  This could represent trouble for my waistline in the future.  Definitely a fan!  Parking is an issue - so use the garage and walk over.
1686,7/31/2015,Stacie H.,fort-worth,5,"Love, love, love the pops here!! Homemade, great flavor choices! Buttermilk is amazing! The long line goes very quickly!"
1687,5/17/2015,Shannon W.,fort-worth,5,"This is such a fun place!  Their Popsicles are unique and yummy! I love that they're made from local ingredients with no added preservatives, and there still delicious!!  My favorite is the buttermilk, think cheesecake in a Popsicle form. Yup, it's as amazing as it sounds!"
1688,5/15/2015,R R.,fort-worth,4,"Best pops we have had, the brownie and the expresso were spot on, just enough to fill in for a cool dessert. Hubby and I split each to get a taste of both.Ordered them to go and they lasted all the way back to our hotel. Great packaging."
1689,7/15/2015,Hannah S.,fort-worth,5,"I never thought i could be so in love with a popcicle! They are delicious and creamy not hard and frozen like most popcicles. The chocolate chip cookie, and the caramel are my favorite."
1690,7/12/2015,Scott N.,fort-worth,5,"Been here twice. My first thought was, outrageous prices for popsicles. My second was, great Popsicles. Nice, fresh, flavorful ingredients. They have free 20-minute parking out front."
1691,7/4/2015,Donny V.,fort-worth,5,"Best way too cool off and finish off a great night out! Stumbled across this place after eating at Fred's. Noticed everyone walking around eating these ice cream bars and we went searching. Not hard to find (long line out the door) and got in line-wait was short. We ordered 3 fruit bars-pineapple, strawberry, & blood orange. Not a bad one in the bunch-fresh fruit and very tasty. The pineapple was my favorite. I will definitely be back to try all the flavors!"
1692,6/30/2015,Jeanne B.,fort-worth,5,"SO Delicious!  I definitely recommend the 4 for $11 so you can try the different ones.  I didn't know what to expect, but WOW!!!  I got strawberry, coffee, chocolate, and caramel pops.  I haven't eaten the coffee or strawberry ones yet, but I can't wait.  Love that you can take them home in a bag with an icepack inside!!!  The caramel I ate first - I LOVE caramel, so I was worried, but this was AMAZING, full of flavor and SO creamy!  Same with the chocolate!!  I'm so glad there's one in Dallas too, because I have to go back.  SO YUMMY!!!"
1693,3/29/2015,Ann V.,fort-worth,5,I wanted to see what all the hype was about. SCP offers many different flavors. I love the fact that they are organic/gluten-free/vegan! I got the Chocolate Brownie Cookie Pop! First time trying anything like it. And it was amazing! My boyfriend got the Mango Pop and it tasted good as well. My boyfriend thinks it's overpriced for a popsicle but hey we would definitely come back. Cute place but just didn't like the fact that the place is very tiny & had limited parking.
1694,3/22/2015,Em S.,fort-worth,4,After much hype I finally got to try this place out. Lines were long but it moved quickly. At $3 / pop it's pretty expensive for a Popsicle. I ordered the chocolate with brownie and it was delicious. Not as sweet as most other places which is what I prefer. Will definitely be back.
1695,12/1/2015,Rimshaw H.,fort-worth,4,"$3 for a popsicle is worth it at this place. You won't regret! I got the coffee flavored one, it was yummy!!"
1696,11/16/2014,Abby S.,fort-worth,5,This place is so delish and organic! its a bit pricey but totally worth it. Parking here sucks and hard to find.
1697,10/5/2014,Jason B.,fort-worth,4,its good. not life changing. id recommend getting a UNTRADITIONAL flavor to truly see their worth. i got plain strawberrry since everything was gone. id go back
1698,7/23/2015,Cathy H.,fort-worth,4,"I should start off with saying my expectations were pretty high. I knew what this would be- an expensive but delicious Popsicle shop. And it was. I have a couple a few issues with dairy, so I opted for a non dairy fruit pop- watermelon. It was kind of flavorless and very, very hard. I guess that makes sense BC a watermelon is like 99% water; this was like biting an icecube. I think I just chose wrong, but for $3 a piece I would personally like there to be no dud flavors on the menu. Anyway, my daughter got the buttermilk, based on the high reviews. It was like the best piece of frozen cheesecake ever. I would certainly go back for it, despite the dairy and the gut churning pain it would leave me in, it was that good. Going back and I will choose better. Even if I can't find a good one for me, I like go back just to take a tiny nibble of someone else's buttermilk Popsicle. Yummmm!!"
1699,8/27/2014,Clarissa H.,fort-worth,3,"This is as the owner describes it: Mexican paletas.  The same paletas sold at Mexican food stores, Mexican carts that bike around neighborhoods, and mexican paleta shops.  The difference is that with them it's $1 a paleta and here (surely because of the location) it's $3.  I tried the banana flavor and it was a good, enjoyed the cinnamon flavor.  I will probably return because it's close to restaurants that I frequent but I still prefer mexican flavors sold at the other places: chamoy, chile-limon, horchata, etc."
1700,8/10/2014,Judy C.,fort-worth,5,"Love this very simple concept.  Super delicious.  Very cool (literally and figuratively) -- Great idea, something different.  The chocolate was great and my friend loved the peanut butter.  Can't wait until winter when they will dip them in chocolate."
1701,1/25/2015,Hoang N.,fort-worth,5,I was brought here by friends who have hyped up these ice creams to me and I gotta say it lives up to the hype. I won't eat at another ice cream place because of steel city. I always go creamy :D.
1702,12/28/2014,Vince L.,fort-worth,5,Ran into Steel City by accident and my wife demanded that we stop since she heard how awesome it was.  Oh man were we happy to have found this place.  Popsicles?  Insane.  So good we went back a few hours later for round two.  I had the Blackberry and my wife had bacon maple bourbon and the kids had vanilla bean with chocolate.  Honey pear for the second trip and buttermilk dipped in chocolate.  Still can't believe I'm reviewing a popsicle joint but it was that good.
1703,8/3/2014,Pat C.,fort-worth,5,Unique wonderful desert! Take a varied selection home with you!  Wait was short and the selection was terrific! It is not like you expect! Frozen heaven on a stick! Oh but parking is a hunt but worth it! Eat across the street at Fred's Texas Café then walk over!
1704,6/18/2015,Andrew Y.,fort-worth,4,"Unique flavors, natural ingredients, delicious dessert Popsicles, fairly priced all with polite service make Steel City Pops a must visit for anyone in the West 7th Street area of Fort Worth.  I've tried many flavors - fruity, creamy, chocolaty and even pops with brownies in them - and each one was terrific."
1705,8/10/2014,H C.,fort-worth,4,"Yummy! This is quickly becoming a family favorite. Coconut, chocolate, and sweet tea are the current flavors of choice. Saw them at the Cowtown Farmer's market yesterday with their cart so you just never know where they will ""pop"" in with pops!"
1706,7/15/2014,Shawn S.,fort-worth,4,"I love Steel City Pops... I have had the caramel, chocolate, and coconut so far but I am sure we will end up trying them all eventually.  They are the best popsicles I have every had for sure.  So creamy! I haven't been inside the new shop yet...only in the patio area where they were selling pops the first day or two after they opened."
1707,9/7/2017,Christine M.,fort-worth-4,5,"Great location ! First time visit for all of us and the lady was super sweet and helped us decide what flavors we wanted .. we decided on strawberry cream , buttermilk dipped in milk chocolate ( which was the winner) and plain chocolate... we will for sure come back .. lots of great restaurants at this location"
1708,9/28/2017,Hazel V.,fort-worth-4,4,"Call me biased but since Steel City is the first ""customizeable pop"" place I've been to I'm sure it'll always hold a special place in my heart.This location wasn't on 7th Street like the first one I went to, this one was over by Whole Foods tucked near a brand new apartment complex being built (HOW LUCKY ARE THEY). It looked like this location just opened up and there wasn't very much traffic. But after a long morning walking around the zoo, we needed something to help us cool down!I got the lemon cream pop which I dipped in white chocolate and topped with coconut. My boyfriend... oh gosh I don't remember what he got anymore! Oh he got the lemon cream pop as well but dipped in milk chocolate with white chocolate drizzle. The lemon cream pop was amazing. I like the milk based pops more than the fruit based ones as the fruit ones are really hard to chew through. The milk based ones are a lot easier and of course more creamy. But it was also super refreshing! There was bits of lemon zest in the pop itself. It wasn't too tarty but was enough to make it exactly what we needed on a hot day!"
1709,9/8/2017,Jessica T.,fort-worth-4,4,"Cute place. They sell several flavors and offer to dip them in chocolate and add toppings for an additional fee.If you are looking for a light refreshing snack, I would recommend the fruit flavors. I ordered the lime pop and it was under 100 calories. The nice thing is that they post the calorie amounts under each flavor on the menu. They are on the pricer side. At about $4 a pop. But I suggest you try it at least once."
1710,7/28/2017,Dwayne O.,fort-worth-4,3,"Primary item here are Popsicles, not bad but to have a stand alone shop may be better off with a cart or food truck.I liked the cookies and cream also thought the Strawberry Cream was very good, the peach cream was just okay especially on a warm 95 degree day.I believe you can dip them or add other condiments to them. A little on the pricy side for what you get."
1711,6/20/2017,Julia D.,fort-worth-4,5,"Always a favorite spot and so nice to have one away from the busy west 7th area. Stopped by for a treat and wanted as few calories as possible. The peach bar at 109 calories was fantastic. My daughter had the peaches and cream and loved it. If I was splurging I would have a coconut dipped in chocolate, dipped in pecans, drizzled with white chocolate and dusted with cayenne. Maybe next time."
1712,7/8/2017,Rob M.,fort-worth-4,5,"My first time trying this place. A perfect way to end a big meal. My family was bragging about this place. I was Like a popsicle is a popsicle right? Nope, these are more than a popsicle...try for yourself"
1713,3/27/2017,Lex W.,fort-worth-4,4,"Love that this new Steel City Pops is at the Waterside plaza, I frickin love the Waterside plaza! you can get yourself a pop and then meander on over to the Grove to sit, hang out, or play life-size Jenga!I love that the flavors of the pops are rotational. You can choose from fruity or creamy pops, and something new is a pop of the day (or it could be month, can't remember!), and you can also add stuff to your pop like chopped nuts, caramel or chocolate drizzle, etc. I brought my family here over Spring Break for a snack. Each pop was about $3-$4. I was sure to use my loyalty card, which has since been switched over to phones--technology!Noteworthy flavors were the vanilla bean and pineapple jalapeno. Three of us tried the pop of the day/month which was mocha crunch something. Only problem was that instead of a mocha pop, they gave all three of us banana pops which did affect the final flavor. It took us a while to realize it wasn't the right pop--we all that we were imagining the banana flavor! Not sure how all three pops got swapped to banana, but oh well. By the time we figured that out we had already finished them. But the idea of the pop was great. There's a decent amount of seating inside which is nice if you don't want to sit outside. When we visited there were two employees working. Both were friendly enough and got us our pops promptly. I think the biggest appeal of this place is the unique flavors of the pops. While this wouldn't be the first place I'd go to for a cold treat, it's definitely fun to try if you are visiting Waterside. :-)"
1714,9/6/2017,Sheenz T.,fort-worth-4,5,"Couldn't decide between the passion fruit and pomegranate pop, ended up trying the passion fruit pop -  delicious!"
1715,7/5/2017,Stephanie W.,fort-worth-4,5,"Delicious popsicles! The vanilla bean, chocolate. Brownie, and cookies and cream are delicious!"
1716,2/21/2017,Rashell M.,fort-worth-4,5,So what's not to love about delicious homemade popsicles. You can't go wrong with anything you choose and if u don't happen to like what u pick they will give u a new one. Because one time I got a cantaloupe one not my favorite. I recently got lemon cream it was fantastic.
1717,6/17/2017,Kelly O.,fort-worth-4,4,Super cute place in my favorite part of Fort Worth! How could you not go in and try one!? I got the chocolate brownie cookie pop. It was delicious. I loved the chunky texture. The menu has a good variety of normal and unique flavors. They have something for everyone. A little over priced but these pops are addictive!
1718,8/31/2017,Ben S.,fort-worth-4,5,Strawberry lemonade pop... SO good!! And it's not bad for calories as well. I think it was only 80-something calories. The workers were really helpful explaining what I can get with each flavor. It's a really fun place to go. Try it out sometime!
1719,2/1/2017,Bri B.,fort-worth-4,5,"Totally awesome!!! We were greeted nicely by the staff member working! She was very helpful in suggesting what we should try. And with that being said we did the 4 pops for $11 bucks...great deal right??!! We got the blood orange, strawberry lemonade, root beer float and coffee pops! Everything was so good! My most favorite was the strawberry lemonade pop. It tasted like how an actual Chili's strawberry lemonade should taste!!! I highly recommend this pop! The root beer pop was really good too! Very flavorful with the right amount of cream and root beer taste! Happy Yelping!"
1720,3/26/2017,Leticia C.,fort-worth-4,5,Good Location! Ice cream pops are really good! They did not have vanilla or chocolate today when we went but the other flavors we purchased were just as good!
1721,6/17/2017,Sophia K.,fort-worth-4,5,The staff was very warm and provided excellent suggestions to try. They even stated to not hesitate to ask for another flavor if the combination you selected didn't fulfill your expectation.
1722,6/25/2017,Kimberly B.,fort-worth-4,5,I absolutely love this place. There are so many combinations you can do. I enjoy the cream popsicles the most and I loved them dipped in white chocolate. Once you go you will be hooked too
1723,12/24/2016,Alexis C.,fort-worth-4,5,"First time here and it was great. It was cold outside but I really wanted to try their special popsicles. I opted for a creamy one: Pistachio, and didn't get anything added. It was so good! There were nuts embedded into the top and bottom and it just made it all come together very nicely. For about $3/popsicle (plain) it's worth what you're paying for. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying more flavours!"
1724,4/24/2017,Cheryl T.,fort-worth-4,5,"Avocado popsicle...OMG. If you like Keylime pie, your taste buds will jump for joy with this frozen treat. I demolished it within a couple minutes. I totally would've eaten two more. :)"
1725,3/30/2017,Shelly V.,fort-worth-4,5,What a great second location for a steel city.  Easy and convenient to get into and out of. The employees are friendly and helpful if you can't decided what delicious flavor to pick. I love that the menu stays seasonal. One of my favorite places to pick up a treat any day of the week. Love it!
1726,6/17/2017,Lesly S.,fort-worth-4,5,The Pops are so creamy and have such a unique flavor that you couldn't find anywhere else. We entered and it was awkward but the employees were very friendly and would definitely recommend !
1727,5/14/2017,Jeff C.,southlake-southlake,5,This was the first time I've been to Steel City Pops and it was pretty cool. Business was poppin' and it was pretty packed inside. The nice cashier recommended that I get the Avocado flavor and said I could switch it out for freeeee if I didn't think it was good.It was actually pretty good. It was cold like a popsicle should be and Avocado flavory like you'd expect something Avocado flavored to be. I would post a picture but I ate it before I could take a picture. It was green ish looking.Would definitely go back sometime~Maybe
1728,8/6/2017,Hanna C.,southlake-southlake,3,"Popsicles are great, but you're being served by entitled Southlake teens, so expect zero greetings, thank yous, or have a nice days. But seriously the coconut popsicle is sooo yummy."
1729,7/8/2017,Devi S.,southlake-southlake,4,"My sister introduced my family and I to this place.  I was NOT disappointed at all.. Very unique flavors (chocolate chilies, strawberry lemonade, coffee, etc..) definitely a good place to come and cool down from the Texas heat.  The portions of the pops was pretty big, wish they have a smaller size for kids because it is such a waste if they can not finished one by them self.Recommendation to the owners: Kids pops size; also how about a Sampler size?? Out of one bar of pop i can get 6 cuts, for some of us that feel like trying different flavor on one visit instead of having to buy 6 full size pops to try .  Just an idea .I would definitely recommend this place when you are in the area of Southlake, TX.  You will not be disappointed."
1730,5/19/2017,Cecilia P.,southlake-southlake,4,"This Steel City Pop is much bigger than the one in Fort Worth and I'm glad they made another location. They had some tables and chairs set up inside. Much more room.Walked in, their menu is different from the Fort Worth one, the one in Fort Worth is usually on a chalk board, the Southlake one has a similar menu like fast food places. It took a minute or two for the employee to came out from the back and take our order. I got a honeydew, my sister in law got earl tea, and her boyfriend got banana coated with milk chocolate. The young lady who took our order didn't seem to be in a good mood, no smile, and when she was coating the ice cream she wasn't anywhere close to happy. The one in Fort Worth is more welcoming.But I won't let that ruin my experience at this location. I have a couple favorites from Steel City Pop such was blood orange, mango, banana, coconut. But honeydew was not one of them this time. Looking forward to trying another new flavor though!"
1731,8/18/2017,Don R.,southlake-southlake,3,"Very original concept, and the line is often out the door - but moves quickly. I'm not gong to fall in love with the product after one visit, as both our Cookie Pops were essentially a bar frozen within vanilla ice cream for $4.50. I had the Peanut Butter Pie, and I'm looking forward to trying others. It's a little tough on the first visit, trying to decide between flavors, and then if you want it Dipped, Dredged, Drizzled or Dusted. Most of the Pops are $3. A premium for the novelty, of course, but a price that's not too outrageous for it's originality.  We'll see how the next visit goes, and I'll update the rating accordingly."
1732,5/11/2017,Kaity M.,southlake-southlake,4,"Yummy dessert place if you are looking for something light and delicious. Kind of a little drive for us, but it hit the spot. Similar to popbar if you live in CA.I had a strawberry lemonade popsicle, my mom had a peanut butter with a dark chocolate 'dredge' and my husband had a coffee popsicle with a milk chocolate drizzle. They loved theirs and it lasted a really long time before they started to melt. Price was good and the service was pleasant and fast.There are also a lot of shops and places to eat nearby. Great date night spot."
1733,9/1/2017,Adam G.,southlake-southlake,4,An excellent complement to other dessert options in the area when I'm tired of Menchie's or Milwaukee Joes.  A variety of options from fruit to ice cream to suit any taste and all can be dipped in multiple chocolate sauces.  I prefer the lighter fruit flavors while my kids get cookies and cream pop.
1734,3/15/2017,David V.,southlake-southlake,4,"Pretty excited we have a Steel City Pops on our side of town. We used to have to go downtown Fort Worth W.7th or lower Greenville.Came here for the cookies and cream cookie bar. It was delicious as always. We also tried their flavor of the month, It was a mocha flavored bar dipped in chocolate and drizzled w caramel. Pretty good, but I liked the cookies and cream bar better.The cashier was nice and friendly. We came on a Wednesday afternoon and there was line but it went by pretty fast. As with all Steel City Pops, they have some indoor seating and also some nice picnic tables outside:-)Can't wait to come back and try some more flavors!"
1735,8/9/2017,Reena D.,southlake-southlake,5,The best ever and I am sooo happy there is one near me.  My favorite is the cookies n cream pop!  Its so freaking good with chunks of cookies.  It was worth every single bite.  This location is bigger than the FW one.  Definitely coming back here soon.
1736,4/24/2017,Gricelda P.,southlake-southlake,4,"I love me some Steel City pops.I have been a fan of their Fort Worth and Lower Greenville locations, so visiting the Southlake one was a no brainer.The location is a little hidden, since the area in the shopping center is still under construction, but the location is roomie and they have the same delicious pops as the rest.My personal faves are Mango, Passion Fruit and Blood orange. The only reason why I don't give them 5 stars is because the employees are just really young girls talking to each other about random things instead of paying attention to the customers.They are not service minded at all. Hopefully that will change with time since this is a new location."
1737,8/7/2017,Carlie M.,southlake-southlake,3,"HUGE wait line. Not a lot of seating inside or out. I got the passion fruit and was super excited, and at first it was really yummy. About 2/3 of the way through, it started tasting funky. The pops are really big, so it might just have been too slobbery? Kind of gross sounding. A little pricey for something as simple as popsicles."
1738,8/30/2017,Ben C.,southlake-southlake,5,Good little trendy ice cream shop in southlake.  I got the peanut butter pie dipped in milk chocolate.  It was really good!  My kid loves this place more than cheesecake factory!
1739,7/29/2017,Shells P.,southlake-southlake,5,"Delicious! It was a great after dinner dessert.  Very popular place so you should expect a line but, they do keep the line moving.  The fruit pop, creamy pop, dip, drizzle and dusting were all good choices.  Will definitely be back!"
1740,4/30/2017,Julie W.,southlake-southlake,5,"Love, love, love! So glad you have this new location. Great popsicles. Yes, popsicles but they take them to a level your childhood popsicle didn't likely have. Amazing and creative flavorers. You can even customize them with different things. There is some inside seating and also some outside. One of our favorite places for a dessert or something light and refreshing."
1741,7/21/2017,Shelby D.,southlake-southlake,5,"Unique flavors like avocado, lavender lemonade, cantaloupe, chai tea, and blueberry basil. Selection rotates, so it's never the same- but there's always something good. Really glad this location opened up!!"
1742,6/4/2017,Kate B.,southlake-southlake,3,"I wanted this to be the coolest thing since sliced bread. I really did. Basically it's a bunch of popsicles that they put in a little cardboard rectangle to put some toppings on. It's fine but for $3 a popsicle, I would rather get ice cream. I did like that the calories were listed but most of them are not any healthier than ice cream. It's a nice alternative but just eh in my opinion."
1743,6/2/2017,Sarah B.,southlake-southlake,4,"Despite being out of the flavor I wanted, my second choice was really flavorful--strawberry lemonade. Perfect for a quick cold snack while enjoying the grove. I drizzled mine with dark chocolate that was the perfect accoutrement to the fruity pop. My buddy got an oatmeal cookie one which was creamy and delicious. Definitely worth a repeat!"
1744,4/17/2017,Ellie M.,southlake-southlake,2,"I visited this Steel City location this past week (on Thursday evening) and found myself quite disappointed by the costumer service I encountered. I've been here before and am usually satisfied by the staff but this time was different. The person who took my order (a young blonde girl) was incredibly rude and snippy- she ended my order with ""is that all?"" in a tone that implied she was bothered by my purchase. Additionally when I requested that she take my phone number she said, ""I guess"" and proceeded to, very rudely, say ""you don't even have a free pop, so""I love Steel City and typically find the costumer service to be great, but I was severely disappointed by this particular employee/encounter. I would've given one star, but the popsicle was really good."
1745,8/5/2017,Maripao S.,southlake-southlake,4,"Pricey but good. Our favourite is cookies and cream dipped in dark chocolate. Don't order coconut, it doesn't even taste like it. Vanilla is pretty good and strawberry"
1746,8/13/2017,Sean A.,southlake-southlake,5,"All I can say is stay away from this place if you don't want the most awesome pops ever! Some of the flavors can be a little strange, but you have to experiment, you never know when you'll try something new and amazing! The blueberry basil is so good, I also dig the chocolate chili!"
1747,5/10/2017,Marilyn W.,southlake-southlake,5,"Great place to get a dessert pop or just a fun treat. Strawberry lemonade popsicles are delicious, fruity and low calorie. My husband enjoyed the banana popsicle. It had a hint of cinnamon. Delicious."
1748,4/9/2017,Katie U.,southlake-southlake,4,"I was excited that there was finally a Steel City Pops closer to me than the one in DTFW. Went on a Friday night and the line was out the door, to be expected. But the workers worked pretty fast so it wasn't long. I got the Pop of the month, which was a coconut pop, covered in dark chocolate topped with nuts and drizzle syrup. It was very good! One of my favorites is the Strawberry lemonade pop or the Melon one. Can't go wrong with a classic coffee pop either."
1749,8/23/2017,Chris A.,southlake-southlake,1,"My family of eight has been here 3-4 times, and thought it was pretty good (fun and unique, but not sensational). After tonight, no more. I ordered a ""Chocolate Chill"" for $3, while my wife and daughter got two other flavors. Theirs were fine, but mine was frozen hard as a rock - truly, I couldn't even bite it. I waited a couple of minutes, but it was still un-eatable (is that even a word?) because I couldn't bite it. So, I went inside, told the very young girl my problem, and asked for something else that wasn't so hard. She said, ""Sorry, we can't do that. They are frozen, you know."" I responded, ""I understand that, but this is literally frozen solid and I can't eat it. The other two we got were not, so there has to be something different about this one."" Her response, in typical entitled young teen fashion, was, ""Well, sorry, we can't do anything about it."" I put the frozen one down on the counter, and walked out. For the last time, I might add."
1750,5/11/2017,Malynn P.,southlake-southlake,5,Love this place! Delicious pops with something for everyone. Also love the fact that they list nutritional values for those of us who need to count them calories :) strawberry with chocolate drizzle and cookies and cream are my faves. So many more to try. I see many trips in my future
1751,5/21/2017,Y O.,southlake-southlake,3,Went here for the first time with a group and wasn't sure what we wanted but felt rushed by the male cashier as he seemed annoyed because we were looking at the menu and asking a few questions. Slammed our pops on the top of the glass freezer and kept asking if that was all we wanted. These pops were ok. Nothing special but looked nice. Overpriced. I feel like we could've gotten better tasting ice cream from elsewhere. At least we got to try them but we'll probably stick to Braum's.
1752,8/21/2017,TX M.,southlake-southlake,5,So delicious!!! Love lithe lavender lemonade & peach!! They even have gluten free options!
1753,4/28/2017,Tiffany H.,southlake-southlake,5,So yummy and fun! I love that this location has options to spruce up your popsicle with chocolate and other toppings. Only complaint is that it's always SUPER crowded! Love this place!
1754,3/18/2017,Nye A.,southlake-southlake,4,I got the passionfruit dipped in milk chocolate. It was delicious. Huge line but wonderful customer service. The passionfruit was really refreshing and tasted just like the fruit. I would recommend it highly.
1755,5/4/2017,Julie A.,southlake-southlake,5,"So fun and delicious. Try peanut butter, dark chocolate dipped, dreged in peanuts. Delicious!"
1756,6/12/2017,Jessica Z.,southlake-southlake,2,"Disappointed. Nothing special. Plus, who puts black seeds in their watermelon popsicles?! They were out of a ton of flavors and the person at the register made me feel like an idiot when I asked for strawberry and pointed to the sign that listed the items they were out of, which was small and behind the registers. Might I suggest removing the big sign that says ""flavor of the day!"" when you are out of it and replacing it with the ""out of flavors"" sign so customers can see it."
1757,4/10/2017,Kimberly W.,southlake-southlake,5,"Popsicle shop?! Yes please!!!!! This was a great treat that was refreshing and not overly decadent or rich. I had the coffee pop and it was the perfect cold treat as we walked around doing some window shopping. Hubby has cookies and cream pop. A little more sweet, but super good. It was like a frozen oreo!"
1758,4/10/2017,Rachel S.,southlake-southlake,5,"This place has the best popsicles around! I love how customizable they are, too. Everything is made fresh and is made from natural ingredients. Plus, the employees were very respectful towards me and my service dog in training. Unfortunately, most employees at other places aren't and will talk directly to my dog and will purposefully distract him despite his vest full of patches and a leash wrap that clearly reads ""Do not distract,"" so thank you to the girls at Steel City Pops for not doing that and for giving him room to work. I appreciate that so much. So all in all, great service and great pops!! Just a note-I do not believe Steel City Pops is pet friendly. PLEASE do not bring your pets inside. That includes ESAs (ESAs are not service dogs and are only allowed on planes and in no-pet housing, nowhere else). Doing so is dangerous and makes it harder for legitimate teams like me and my dog to go into places we're legally allowed to go in. Thank you!"
1759,5/22/2017,Teresa K.,southlake-southlake,4,"went here for the first time this weekend. pretty inexpensive but then i just got a plain pop (no drizzle or whatevers). We got there right before the big rush and when we left the line was out the door. they had some really fun flavors that had sold out, so i'll have to try elderflower next time. this time i had raspberry lemon, it was delicious and it didn't melt all over my arm."
1760,3/21/2017,Laura C.,southlake-southlake,5,"Another great steel city location! There is a lot of wonderful outdoor seating in the form of picnic tables which will be great during the spring and fall seasons, or summer evenings! I got the lemon cream pop which was delicious as it wasn't crazy sweet. My friend dipped his mocha pop in milk chocolate, and then got caramel drizzled on top which looked delicious. There was definitely quite a line, but that was to be expected with it being opening week. The service was great, can't wait to go back next time I am home."
1761,5/16/2017,Cositas I.,southlake-southlake,5,Delicious popsicles -- the only problem is that there are so many flavors that it's hard to choose what you want! I've tried the strawberry lemonade and the banana with a chocolate drizzle. Both were excellent!
1762,4/27/2017,Veronique C.,southlake-southlake,5,"Unexpectedly awesome! Didn't expect much from a popsicle place, but was I ever wrong. I had the avocado pop and it tasted just like key lime pie! Dairy free to boot, which is great since I'm lactose intolerant. My daughter had the coffee flavored one dipped in chocolate with caramel drizzle and she said it tasted amazing! We will be back soon!"
1763,5/13/2017,David I.,southlake-southlake,3,"i had the vanilla bean with milk chocolate that was dredged, yes i know, very simple compared to what they have on the menu but it was very good. it could of used a bit more chocolate on it. the reason for the 3 stars, as some have reviewed, is their customer service. this was my first time ever to try Steel City Pops and no one acknowledge that i walked in nor did they say anything while i was standing like a dumb tourist off to the side. not very southlake like"
